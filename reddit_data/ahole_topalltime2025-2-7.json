        "selftext": "Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad. I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else. We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no. Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.  So Reddit, ATIA?",

Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next ~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about ~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long. We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude. I told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts. AITA?  **Update*** Holy fuck this blew up, I know this was shitty of me now. And I reached out to him to see how he's holding up. He's staying at his gf's place and she's supporting him a lot right now. I offered to get my head hunter friend in touch with him when he's ready and he accepted.",

        "selftext": "My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her. For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home. So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out? Edit: I don't live in the USA. Please don't discuss legalities based on the laws there.",

        "selftext": "I have been living with my new wife and stepdaughter for about 6 months now. She\u2019s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She\u2019s a really good kid and she\u2019s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn\u2019t present in her life, nor is my sons\u2019 mother. All four children share a bathroom. My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them.  My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn\u2019t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don\u2019t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display. A few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she\u2019d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet.  She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who \u201csheds like a gorilla\u201d and has produced \u201cthree skid marking sons\u201d which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I\u2019ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it\u2019s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn\u2019t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can\u2019t be flushed and that it\u2019s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes.  I later asked my wife if she could have a word with her and she told me I was being ridiculous and that her daughter has had her period for ten years and knows what she\u2019s doing. When I told her it was making my sons uncomfortable she said my sons needed to get a grip and turned over and went to sleep.  This is a genuine issue to me and she didn\u2019t care enough to have a discussion about it. I asked my stepdaughter again in the morning and she did the same as her mother, completely dismissed it. Both of them have told me to stop being so silly but I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m being unreasonable when it makes my sons uncomfortable. AITA? UPDATE \u2014 Not even two hours after I posted this, my wife and stepdaughter gathered my sons and I and gave us a full intensive \u201cperiods for pricks\u201d course, Powerpoint and all. It was a hoot, they made an interactive quiz and everything. My sons and I learned a lot and apologised to my stepdaughter. Thankyou for your input",

Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes. Some context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy Joey 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react. So fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said Knock knock.. Ethan laughed and said Who's there?. Mike replied Joey's bio parents then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an idiot to which Mike replied with Hey...Relax it was just a joke. An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up. We haven't talked to them for days. I tried contacting Ethan but no response.",

There really is no reason for us to choose truth since we already know a lot about each other so we mostly went just with dares. It was pretty fun and we had some weird challenges. I was staying next to my friends brother and when it was my turn a classmate challenged me to kiss him. His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn\u2019t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn\u2019t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn\u2019t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home). Anyways I did end up leaving. Do you guys think I was the asshole here?

My son had a Minecraft world where he built quite an impressive castle on an island, which he was very proud to show to me. Since school was canceled, he has had issues with waking up on time. He is supposed to wake up at 7 each morning, but for the past month he has been sleeping in until about 9 or 10. I always set an alarm for him, but he sleeps right through it. I don't wake him up because waking himself up is a skill that he needs to learn. I told him about 2 weeks ago that there are going to be consequences for him if he continues to sleep in every morning. At first, he understood and was waking up on time every morning. But for the past week or so, he has fallen back into old habits. I told him yesterday that this is his final warning. Today, he slept in until 11. So I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again. He has been crying and sobbing throughout the day, and has refused to eat any of his meals.",

        "selftext": "Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue.  My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as liberal, he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population. My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels. As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me. Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents. No advice needed, but I have to know. Have I been an ass?",

        "selftext": "What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad.  I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the harmless, funny token fat guy of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough.  Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest.  Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?  I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out.  I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded.  Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night? Edit: I guess I\u2019ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can\u2019t find out why. To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn\u2019t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it\u2019s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don\u2019t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",

I will regret this for the rest of my life, but I was the person who shot up Marcy for the first time. After that, there was no stopping her. She stuck around with me, probably because I was her dealer more than anything, but then I got clean and never saw her again for a long time.

        "selftext": "I have waited tables for the last three years. During my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees.  When I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables. About five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me.  A few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory. It was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber. Several minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse.  I stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct.  But when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.",

        "selftext": "I have a big family that\u2019s incredibly close. We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing.  Some of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc. This dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered.  I told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves. She told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.  My husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL\u2019s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.  My SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as \u201ca vapid slut\u201d and her husband \u201ca pathetic cuck\u201d along with other slurs I don\u2019t want to repeat.  I grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that\u2019s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister\u2019s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.  EDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I\u2019m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We\u2019re definitely concerned for our daughter about what\u2019s happening at school and we\u2019re looking into therapy. For clarification, as for my SIL\u2019s privacy, she didn\u2019t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",

        "selftext": "My younger sister and I were very close when young but no so much now. I was born in fairly well to do Hindu family. I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch. Recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day. My sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her. It all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon. I asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. I suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved. I explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue.  She told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents. At this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house. Later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. She called me 'toxic'. I was just looking out for her.",

        "selftext": "About three years ago my dad was injured in a really bad hit and run car accident. He broke just about every bone in his body, and left him paralysed from the waist down. Our relationship has always been really good, but I hate seeing him in pain and admittedly try to avoid seeing him because it just makes me uncomfortable.  In November I\u2019m getting married. I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 for 4 years and he and my dad get on really well. Naturally the discussion of who was going to give me away came up in the family group chat, and I kept silent after I realised my dad would be in a wheelchair. We always talked about him giving me away and having a dance at my wedding and I don\u2019t want to be reminded of what could\u2019ve been at my wedding. I messaged my mom privately and told her I want my uncle to walk me down the aisle as we\u2019re incredibly close.  She naturally asked why and I told her that my dad being in a wheelchair would add complications to the wedding. The walkway would have to be widened to accommodate his wheelchair and he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold my arm or give me a proper hug. She was outraged, called me an ableist POS and removed me from the group chat. My aunt has since called me telling me my dad is absolutely devastated. AITA? Update - I appreciate all the people who have messaged me offering me support, your kind words have meant a lot to me whilst rifling through a bunch of messages telling me to do horrible things to myself. Regardless of what you think of me, telling me these things isn\u2019t okay. I\u2019m going to call my dad tomorrow Update 2 - can people please stop messaging me such horrendous stuff? think about what you\u2019re saying. You may not agree with me or my life but you\u2019re just as bad as I apparently am if you\u2019re going round saying stuff like that to strangers on the internet UPDATE - Not that I owe it to anyone but I thought I\u2019d give you all an update.

        "selftext": "So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) He told me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally worked out.  As stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something? TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA? Edit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong. Second Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",

Our daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert. However, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night. So, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; Are you enjoying the food? She responded Yes! [Your husband] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman. The room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night. This was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her Sure; if she's going to apologize to me. When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again. She then went to her father and asked. He said sure but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: [Daughter's friend]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go? Yes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.",

        "selftext": "Not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement. I met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.) Our waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column. At the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me. The only one not happy was my date. She said, If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't. and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response. So pardon my french, but what the fuck?",

        "selftext": "So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing.  When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events.  We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this.  Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO!  I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is.  My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a real man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness. Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it? Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance.

I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I\u2019ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I \u201chad come to your senses\u201d I don\u2019t want to disappoint her. It\u2019s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",

        "selftext": "So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she\u2019s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I\u2019m hungry.  I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I\u2019ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people. So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it\u2019s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of my steak?\u201d and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don\u2019t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it\u2019s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it\u2019s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers. I\u2019m complaining to my girlfriend and she\u2019s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I\u2019m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say.  When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that\u2019s where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t let businesses push me around and rip me off.  A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don\u2019t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald\u2019s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It\u2019s now the next day and I\u2019m starting to think I didn\u2019t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to my texts so now I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019m an asshole. Am I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "Saw another post that reminded me of this situation. A few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father. I pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn\u2019t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since. I\u2019ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they\u2019re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn\u2019t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately? Edit- okay I get it I\u2019m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn\u2019t think the triplets had different fathers. I\u2019m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",

        "selftext": "I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa. Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty.  Well a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back.  So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money? Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as why are you so shity? because I've been banned. Edit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201cbaby gangster\u201d who has been running an \u201cillegal gaming operation\u201d (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room. Edit3: gotta address this one directly: >If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission. If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201cwinner\u201d thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process. Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to give it to him.  Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201chey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201d You would say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019s not a freaking illegal gambling operation. Edit5: a good question: >INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino. No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask. Edit6: another good question >Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here? I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner. Edit7:  >INFOWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine nerd could correct me if I'm way off base. Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried. > I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time. Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong. 1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out. 2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the you're a stupid thot rationalizations to come from this one).  3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank.  4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine.  5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old). Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time: >I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit guest actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy. Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the winner almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the malfunction voids all pays and plays clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",

        "selftext": "I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>Who likes to crash at our house with her friends.  My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.My sister said it\u2019s not her. I believe my sister. I just don\u2019t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them. Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy.  My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn\u2019t enough for her and her friends.They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no. They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn\u2019t want anyone else to have a key to our house. I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d anymore. My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house. My mom didn\u2019t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn\u2019t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile.  Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. Between my wife and my sister. Update* sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy. I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn\u2019t allowed over without me home.  I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it\u2019s clean. The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife\u2019s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items. Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid. I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert. Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife\u2019s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape. The big thing is she had my wife\u2019s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife\u2019s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn\u2019t valuable it\u2019s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded. Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn\u2019t have that key. Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.My wife said \u201chave her meet me every morning at 5 am.\u201d I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife\u2019s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife\u2019s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work. My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.I can tell it really hit her that her life isn\u2019t as hard. Even being grounded. Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.1) for awhile no family at our home2) no family borrowing our things. 3)no one is allowed a key4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn\u2019t want to cause more issues but she just doesn\u2019t trust my sister and can\u2019t have her using out things.",

        "selftext": "Context: For every holiday, My mother would ask the women in the family (my sisters, sister in-law, my wife, my female cousins) to send samples of the desserts they plan to bring to the celebration for testing and to see if these desserts could make it to the food menu. My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sent. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.  For this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a cookie sample and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent it to my mother days ago and the results just came in yesterday. I came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list/menu for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said it was done I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it. Later I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.  AITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable? Info. If you're asking whose cookie sample made it to the menu, the answer is my sister and my 2 cousins. Info Few things to put on here: 1. My wife wasn't the only one whose sample was rejected. We have SIL's (brother's wife) and my younger sister's. 2. My mother did not force anyone to participate, it was up to whoever wanted to take part. 3. This is just about the dessert since my mother tends to be very careful in this category but for other types of foods. Dishes/appetizers/salads/stuff like that is welcome as she stated. Update: Great!, so I just got off the phone with my brother and he told me that his wife is doing the same thing as my wife and that she has decided to back out of the invitation to spend christmas with family as well. Turns out my wife must've told her about her decision and she decided to follow her lead. My brother is pissed saying my wife is encouraging his wife to do this. I see that the problem has just gotten bigger now. Who knows, my younger sister might join in and decide not to go as well. I don't know how this got out of control so quickly. I guess we'll try to have a discussion with my mother about this soon and see how it goes.",

        "selftext": "Last week, I was using my sister Ashley\u2019s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d  I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it.  I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me.  I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place.  After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out.  I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far? EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did. Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.  And to the people who said she\u2019ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

        "selftext": "My husband has been working really hard the last two years to advance at his company and he finally got the promotion he's been after. I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat. He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu. AITA? Update: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants. I've apologized profusely to my husband and I am going to take him to that restaurant this weekend and buy him some camping gear he's been eying as a start to making it up to him and changing course.",

        "selftext": "Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here? THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept. INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help.  As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her stuff.  She already has stuff.  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with stuff.  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me. Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die. Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to retire and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week preschool for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and bless me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone. Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.   I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough. UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough things and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on giving generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a new tradition that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded. To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and not bothered to budget for it once it came are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful for that now.",

        "selftext": "Title says it all. My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn\u2019t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn\u2019t even have Candy Crush on her phone. So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do it). After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn\u2019t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests. AITA? Edit: Yep, I'm reading the replies, all 3K of them, it's all very interesting. Not gonna reply to any because reddit people can be weird, I know if I reply to a YTA with anything other than I'm sorry you're right people will say Accept your judgment! and if I reply Thanks to an NTA I will be told I'm just looking for validation. Shout out to @Durvillea who made the effort to DM me the same comment she made here, to quote: Looks like you are one of those girls who are always fat + ugly inside out that you have to be jealous with your rich + pretty friend who always gets attention from guys and has enough money foe different new hobbies. Stop being bitter and leave her alone. You don\u2019t need to also be mean to stay single af as you already are.

I wasn't too over-romantic, but said I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me. A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here?

        "selftext": "I'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. I've lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors. So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great. This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food. I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before. Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more. So, AITA? EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before. EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",

My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there. He came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend. He yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying good riddance *edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.* *update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger.

I hate drinking I have never drank my father was an alcoholic I think it\u2019s childish if you can\u2019t have fun without drinking. This year I\u2019m hosting Christmas for a change I decided since it\u2019s at my house no alcohol allowed we are all getting older and it\u2019s time to grow up. My husbands sister called to ask what she could bring. She saw a recipe for a Christmas martini that she wanted to bring. I told her about my no alcohol rule. She didn\u2019t say much but must have told the rest of the family. Some of them started texting me asking me if I was serious and saying that it is lame. But I\u2019m not budging.  Now it turns out my husbands sister is hosting an alternate gathering that almost everyone is choosing to go to instead. It\u2019s so disrespectful all because they would have to spend one day sober.  My husband told me he talked to his sister and we are invited to her gathering and he said we should just go and stop causing issues but I won\u2019t it\u2019s so rude.  Now husband is mad because I\u2019m making him stay home and spend Christmas with me but it was my turn to host and I chose to have a no alcohol they could have dealt with it for one year.",

We ordered our food, and were heading out when the cashier held out a giant piece of candy and said 'for your lovely daughter' to me.

My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn\u2019t Catholic and wouldn\u2019t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn\u2019t know there. He\u2019d think it\u2019s way too fancy, way too much.  He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201d played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d and \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust.\u201d  To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren\u2019t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I\u2019ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it.  WIBTA? Edit: I didn\u2019t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don\u2019t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes,  This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn\u2019t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought.  I also reached out to some of my brother\u2019 s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we\u2019re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it.  I was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so I wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",

Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't. When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.  Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake. ETA to clear few points: * For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had. * I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook. * I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes.

        "selftext": "This might be a bit long but thanks for reading.  I\u2019ve been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He\u2019s not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He\u2019s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it\u2019s helped somewhat. Their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son\u2019s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge.  My daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would.  Her college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn\u2019t leave, and he wasn\u2019t calm for hours. I\u2019d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it.  She called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I\u2019d missed every game and performance she\u2019d had as a child and it clearly wasn\u2019t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can\u2019t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I\u2019ve barely spoken with her since. She didn\u2019t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn\u2019t shown up for holidays and I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s engaged but didn\u2019t call to tell me. She\u2019s cut us out, and in the one of three times we\u2019ve spoken since she said it\u2019s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn\u2019t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now.  AITA - I\u2019ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn\u2019t a perfect mom growing up - I didn\u2019t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. I\u2019m heartbroken but I don\u2019t think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",

        "selftext": "I'll admit I'm biased right off the bat. I couldn't stand her. I call her his ex to myself and others. He called her his friend. We're all in our early 40s. She died recently - aneurysm.  I've been with him 10 years now, but he'd known her for 20+. The way he tells it: They were friends in college, decided to date, got married, then realized they weren't a great couple and decided to just be friends. All that happened years before I met him. He was clear early on that she was important.  A couple months into dating, it came up that his *friend* was actually his *ex-wife*. He explained the above to me, saying she was one of his closest friends and that it was purely platonic. I expressed some discomfort at him being so close to an ex, and he told me That's fine. If you have a serious issue with it, let me know now and save us some time. I'll choose her. I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing.  When we were engaged I asked again. He gave me this perplexed look & asked Why would us getting married affect my friendships? I sucked it up & went along. I resented every moment of knowing her, especially when we had to be social. She understood some part of him I couldn't. Her husband was friends with mine as well, so it's not like I could use him as an angle. He'd have lunch with the ex, they'd go to their geeky movies, and whatever.  The few times I brought it up he said We had this conversation before. You had your chance to back out. She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved. He was working with her husband on funeral planning. I told him You don't think you're going, do you? My argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore. He doesn't get to use his she's my friend excuse since she doesn't exist anymore. He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his. He was the angriest I've ever seen him when I told him that, replying that he'll be going no matter how I feel, and that he's willing to burn this to the fucking ground while holding up his wedding band. Besides you, she was the closest friend in my life. Him, her husband & my sisters are calling me an insensitive asshole over this, all saying that there was no romantic aspect to their relationship, & that I'm heartless. Her husband went so far as calling me a ghoul for how I've reacted. I never felt their relationship was appropriate, and I hid that for years because I wanted to be  with my husband. Now that she's gone, I don't feel I should have to hide it anymore, and can speak freely.  AITA for just wanting him to be *done* with her, and for him to not attend the funeral?",

        "selftext": "I work at an office where I\u2019m allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the \u201cno jeans policy.\u201d She frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire.  Problem is, for the past few months that I\u2019ve been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. Tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. That is, until a few days ago.  I love wearing jeans, and have always felt I could make them professional too. I was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. She said something basically confirming her stance on jeans.  I said \u201cWell, the girls get to wear jeans.\u201d \u201cNo they don\u2019t.\u201d Then, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she wasn\u2019t allowed to wear jeans.  In the moment, Amanda appeared playfully mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad. I apologized, saying I didn\u2019t want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans.  AITA? EDIT/ UPDATE: Wow, did not expect all of the responses, though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised about the polarization. At work today, it wasn\u2019t bad. Only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. I do feel bad that I ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day I will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. Thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",

        "selftext": "Update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)    I've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long. She's a self-proclaimed foodie, which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original.  If you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs. (It doesn't stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.) That's not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years.  It's gotten to the point where I don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi. Our anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again. We ended up going out instead. It kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden because she likes the red sauce or other places because she likes the food, and now that I'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because I've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often. She also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I've ever seen so I kinda think it's just an excuse. I just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent. TL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own? Edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected. Edit 2: I'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick Edit3: no, twitter, I don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward? Also, yes, I wash the dishes #Final Edit: Okay guys. This will probably be my last edit. This post exploded unexpectedly and I've tried to respond to as many comments as I can, but there's just too many of you. If you've asked me a direct question and I haven't answered, I'm sorry. My inbox is a mess. I really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything. So her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me. She said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'.  I'm pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation. So, Reddit, you were all right. I'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants. ",

        "selftext": "This is my throwaway account.  My (37F) babysitter (16F) has been babysitting for me for about 2 months. She\u2019s a very sweet and quiet girl and is good with the kids (4F and 8M), we\u2019ve only had small problems here and there but nothing major at all. When she first started babysitting for me I had asked her if there were any drinks or snacks that she\u2019d like me to keep at the house as she\u2019s here from 9-7 every day Monday through Saturday. She mentioned that she really liked seltzer water and I had bought them for the first month, but honestly I forgot after a while and never kept any in the fridge. A few days ago I bought hard seltzer\u2019s for me and my husband, and didn\u2019t think anything of it. A little bit after 2 pm she messaged me that she wasn\u2019t feeling well and thought that she may have to go home, if it was possible if I could get off from work earlier. I asked her to try and hold out until the end of the day. Not too long after she called me crying, saying that something was wrong and she had to go home. She was drunk clearly, she drank the hard seltzer\u2019s. I told her to leave and she walked home. She messaged me the next day and said that she now knew that hard seltzer\u2019s were alcohol, and she hadn\u2019t know, she never drank before as both of her parents were alcoholics and she has diagnosed PTSD regarding alcohol, she never planned on drinking in general. I told her not to come back as she put my children in danger. She called me crying and saying that she didn\u2019t know, and that she cared deeply about my children and would never ever drink with them, or at all, and that she needs the money to pay for her drivers permit (she comes from a not so well off family). I told her to find a real job and that it wasn\u2019t my fault she got drunk. My husband says I\u2019m being very rude and that she did try to reach out when she wasn\u2019t feeling well. My kids are upset to see her go. So reddit, AITA? Edit: okay guys, I\u2019m the asshole. I see it now. Thank you. I\u2019ll hire her again. Edit #2: I will pay her $1500 a week from now on. And pay for her permit and test. As well as her license test.",

        "selftext": "This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think. Me and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life. Last year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore. As she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family\u2019s responsibility to clean up the house'. Since I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming.  Unfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying. So, AITA in this situation? EDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea. EDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve (m32) been dating Siobhan (f32) for 6 months now. She\u2019s always been very vague about what she does for a living (sati things like writing and working from home writing) but recently, one of her friends mentioned something and I finally dragged it out of her. She\u2019s an author, she write and self published romance and erotica stories and novels and while not rich, she\u2019s able to make a living out of it. I googled her name and couldn\u2019t find anything so I confronted her about this. She said she\u2019s writing under a pen name so I demanded she gives it to me so I know what she does. She refuses saying she doesn\u2019t want it to be leaked even by accident and no one knows. I accused her of not trusting me and she still refused which was really annoying. I tried nicer approach and told her that I want to know her fantasies so I can try it out with her and she told me that what she writes aren\u2019t her fantasies but her readers and she\u2019s still not going to tell me. At night I tried to check her laptop for her pen name but she changed her password before bed. I was annoyed and told her she clearly doesn\u2019t trust me and it\u2019s not fair because I have a right to know what she writes especially since it\u2019s a sensitive topic and I don\u2019t know her if I don\u2019t know her pen name. She was furious I tried to look on her laptop and told me to go home. Before leaving I told her when she calls to apologize, I expect to get her pen name with the apology.She called me an asshole on my way out. I thought she\u2019d call by now but she hasn\u2019t. My sister told me I was the asshole and I should apologize but I just don\u2019t see it and need. Second opinion. Was I the asshole?",

        "selftext": "So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time.   A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't switch days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged.   Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the good news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to think of them. I told him tough luck and hung up on him.  Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ask them in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was not letting daddy take them to Disneyland. Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.  I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being can't tell them the truth cause they already know it.   I'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",

        "selftext": "In January of 2019, my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour. It was in a completely inoperable part of the brain, and was told me had six months to live. He stuck it out and died in October, three months longer than he was expected to. He was always positive, and decided a few weeks after his diagnosis that he would write letters for our daughters for significant events in their lives. My husband was my soulmate, and the past few months have been difficult knowing I\u2019ve lost him  We have two daughters, Mia who is 21 and Imogen (Immy) who is 19. All three of us have become a lot closer since their dads death, and we\u2019ve all really struggled. My husband and I were together since we were children, got married when we were 18 and we were approaching our 20th wedding anniversary when he passed.  In February of this year, Mia got married to a boy she\u2019s been with for about 6 years. I absolutely love her husband and he\u2019s been incredibly supportive during all of our grief. My husband wrote a letter for Mia to open on her wedding day. It\u2019s worth noting that my daughters were unaware of these letters, it was my job to give them to our daughters.  Her wedding day comes around and I just can\u2019t bring myself to give her the letter. I read it and just wanted to keep it to myself. I had his handwriting and his words and it felt like he was there, and I couldn\u2019t bare the thought of giving that up yet. I was fully intending on giving her all the other letters as the events happened.  Last week Mia and her husband bought their first home together. They\u2019d been living at our home since they got married, and so had a lot of stuff to pack and move to their new house. Mia asked me where her important documents were, passport, birth certificate etc, so I told her they were in my top drawer of my dresser in my bedroom. The only letter that was in there was the one I was meant to give her on her wedding day, the rest were hidden away.  She immediately recognised his handwriting and of course it was addressed to her, so she read it and broke down. She came and found me and started screaming at me asking how I could be so selfish. I didn\u2019t really know what to say apart from the fact that I wanted to keep it and she could take a picture of it. Both my daughters called me an asshole and are convinced I\u2019m keeping them from a load of their dads stuff. AITA? EDIT - have your opinions, that\u2019s why I posted this. But do not come into my PMs and tell me I should\u2019ve been the one to die instead. You\u2019re worse than I am if that\u2019s what gets you off. Sending me death threats isn\u2019t okay either",

        "selftext": "My daughter (14) had anxiety problems ever since she was little but it was not severe. 3 months ago, my daughter changed drastically. She stopped eating, talking to us or her friends and her marks dropped. We were really concerned and her teachers strongly suggested we take her to therapy which we did and she was diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety which was expected. The therapy sessions look like they helped her well, in the first month she already began making progress and started talking to us and her friends again and is eating whatever her mother is cooking. We were really happy to see this and every day she would get better and better. The thing is, her marks did not. They are terrible and she ended up barely passing the year. This is what infuriated me and made me cancel her therapy sessions. I know to some it might sound terrible, but paying $120 per session and seeing no progress in her marks makes me feel like I am seriously wasting my money (now that she returned back to normal). Not only that but since she really enjoys going to therapy I think telling her that she needs to get higher marks to continue her therapy sessions will motivate her to study harder and thus score better marks. My wife disagrees with my logic and we had a massive argument because of it which ended up with her saying that she is going to pay from \u2018her money\u2019 which hurt me since I see my and her money as ours. My daughter is also really upset on me and was begging me to keep her therapy sessions but I think I am going to stick to this plan. AITA here? EDIT: I deeply apologize for my ignorant replies and for hurting so many people. Please know that I had no intention in offending anyone and it was so upsetting to see how mental illness has affected many of you. I hope you guys can overcome this one day.

        "selftext": " 2 weeks ago my son [Ethan, 27]and his wife [Jess, 30] bought a small one story house in the town we live in. After settling down they invited us for a small party for the occasion. We sat for dinner and talked about the house a bit. Me, my husband and Jess continued conversing after Ethan excused himself to take an important call. Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!. She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful . My husband and I left in a rush and I felt horrible. My husband went on and on about how paranoid and controlling I was to basically be demanding a copy of the key to the new house but again I stated that I was just trying to be helpful and taking extra precautions since anything could happen but he insisted I overstepped and ruined Ethan's and Jess's joy for their new house as well as dinner. I genuienly do not think what I said was out of line and I'm not sure why Jess reacted so intensely. I think my request was innocent.",

She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast. My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks). I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave. Since then, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA? Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn\u2019t she have asked?? Edit 2: and no she still hasn\u2019t responded to me Edit: I\u2019m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I\u2019m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it\u2019s early in my time zone Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future. Also, I am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",

They accidentally kicked their football into our yard and they came into the garden to get it back. Tbh, I didnt care but my boyfriend started screaming at these like 11 year ds about how they are poorly raised and their parents should be ashamed. I. Was. Fucking. Mortified. I sent the kids some chocolates and sweets and apologised profusely for his behaviour.  I was seeing red flags and told him this behaviour was NOT normal. He kind of brushed me off and I told him if he pulled anything like that again he was gone.  The next week the ball came into our garden and I was about to throw it back to the kids when my boyfriend stormed outside and took the ball inside. I told the kids that I would bring it back in a minute. He went into the bathroom and emerged like 10 minutes later wearing gloves and a football covered in shit. HIS OWN SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK. I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind but he stormed past me and threw it over the fence screaming TAKE THAT YOU BITCHES. I screamed and girl I mean screamed at him about how he was a fucking douche and I wanted him out of my house and he is a disgusting fucking monster and that they were just kids. I screamed and screamed and eventually he left. I deleted all his games off of his ps4 and gave it to the kids as an apology. I was so embarrassed. My ex-bf's mom messaged me asking what happened and I responded with What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? You are a pathetic excuse of a woman who raised a fucking sociopath who covered a football in his own shit and threw it at some kids and he needs to be a in a facility because something is wrong with him and god knows how I hadn't seen any red flags about the fucking monster you raised during the 7 months we dated.

I warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella. One friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking.  Roughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy. AITA for standing by my word and not saving my friend from the rain?",

        "selftext": " Hi. A couple of weeks ago we had a new employee hired at the company. he's a good guy and a widower named James (36) and to my knowledge his late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) and the other coworkers got along well with him. However I noticed that he is still wearing his wedding band on his finger. It kind of confused me a bit and I couldn't help but bring it up with him while on lunch break. We talked and I pointed out that he was being misleading by still wearing his wedding band when he's a widower. He looked quite bothered by what I said but I tried to explain that I think that he was giving people the wrong idea or impression about his relationship status since he's technically single and on his own right now (don't want to sound cruel but I'm speaking from technical angle).James said that he didn't give it much thought (meaning he don't care what people think) and that even if he wasn't wearing his wedding band and some woman approached him he'd still turn them down since he's obviously not interested. For some reason things got awkward and everyone stopped eating and just stared at James and me.I told him I don't know but that really really felt generally misleading of him as in making people think he is in a relationship (married) when he is not regardless of how he felt about being in a relationship. He got upset, called me rude, and said that I repeatedly disrespected his marriage and his late wife's memory with what I said then took his stuff and walked away. My co workers said regardless of who is right or wrong (though some said he overreacted) there was no reason for me to bring this up on the first place and cause a scene and make James upset with us like that now he's not speaking to me and others who sided with me. AITA? Did I overstep or did he overreact? This was just a conversation we were casually having with the other co workers and I didn't use any insensitive tones or anything but we had a discussion and it suddenly turned into an argument. I tried to let things calm down but the situation got out of my hand unexpectedly.",

These past few weeks I decided to eat my cupcake before going inside. She asked me where my cupcake is and I told her I don't like cupcakes anymore so I only bought two. It worked for a while but last night when I was enjoying my cupcake before going inside she caught me and ran to her mom to tell her how much of a Terrible dad I am to steal her frostings for weeks She is sulking and my wife thinks I'm the ah and I'm acting childish and should just let her have it but it's easy for her to say when she has never given up HER frosting. AITA? Edit: everyone is taking this very seriously lol. My daughter is not an entitled spoiled brat. Honestly I think she doesn't even love frosting that much she only does it to annoy me. I made this post because my wife likes this sub so I wanted to show her that I'm not the ah Edit2: a lot happened since I posted here. My wife is getting a divorce. She says she can't live with a liar. Cps came to our home to take our child away. They said we are terrible parents for letting our child eat frosting but by the time they got here our daughter wasn't home why? Because the cops came and arrested her for stealing a car. They said frosting thieves always become car thieves so there is no need waiting. She should go to jail asap. When she got there she called me and said she is going nc because I lied to her and she can't trust me anymore. Meanwhile we are getting calls from her friends telling us horror stories about our daughter bullying them. Our life is ruined. All because of a cupcake Nahhh lol So my daughter and I had a serious conversation about this problem and we came to an agreement. She said she'll stop stealing my frostings if I stop stealing her chips so we're good XD Edit3: some people clearly didn't realize second edit was a joke because I keep getting no this didn't happen its fake messages. Yeah geniuses you are right",

Her bedroom used to be right next to our tiny living room. To make our tiny living room into a normal sized living room, we knocked out my daughter's room's wall, refloored the space and fixed the walls. Now it looks like the bedroom was never there and we have a spacious living room. When my daughter came home to visit and saw that her room is gone, she made a huge deal about it. She got all emotional and said if we never wanted to let her move back, we should've just said so instead of completely demolishing her room. I told her that if anything happens and she needs to move back, we will welcome her and she could sleep on the couch as long as she wants. But she accused us of wanting to get rid of her forever and for her to never visit us since we got rid of her room so fast, only a few months after she moved out and we should've waited longer.

        "selftext": "Where I live, real estate developers have started snatching up family homes, bulldozing them and building enormous 2 million dollar houses on the plots of land. The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics \u2013 think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle. My home\u2019s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we\u2019d hold parties, etc. It\u2019s been a neighborhood treasure for years. Until developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it. The new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s. We finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they\u2019d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren\u2019t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven\u2019t been very friendly. The guy says that he\u2019s surprised considering it felt like a \u201cnice\u201d and somewhat \u201caffluent\u201d neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors. I asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake? They said they didn\u2019t know what I meant, so I asked if they\u2019d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute. I said \u201cYes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure. The guy said \u201cWell it\u2019s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?\u201d I said \u201cWell, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.\u201d I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day. When I told another neighbor about the exchange, she told me that she does feel bad for them moving without having any idea what they were getting themselves into.

She doesn\u2019t talk a lot and when she does talk, she\u2019s so quiet that you can barely hear her.  She used to eat in her car but one of my friends felt bad for her and invited her to eat with us. I noticed that all of her lunches had a little piece of paper and she\u2019d read it, smile for like 2 seconds, then fold it up and put it in a pocket in her lunchbox. Sometimes she\u2019d take it out and read it a couple times during lunch. I eventually asked what it is and she said she has a nanny and she writes her notes every day. I asked if she thinks that\u2019s a little embarrassing because I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s had notes in their lunches past 5th grade.  She got kinda defensive and said that her nanny does similar things for her siblings, who are all in preschool or elementary school so it kinda proved my point.  She started eating in her car again and one of my friends got mad at me because apparently she had a really bad home life before moving here and she\u2019s never had anyone do that stuff for her. Idk how tf she expected me to know, considering she usually only talks about school but it\u2019s starting some drama in my friend group so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",

        "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor. Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers. Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom. Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are. Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible.  On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament. My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?",

        "selftext": "Upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. Its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). In the privacy our relationship, I playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. However, he has complained in the past about how much he hates locker room moments when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not.  So the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. One of the cues was something like, things that are short and I write down, my boyfriend's penis. They were all read aloud and when its revealed that I wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. My boyfriend tries to brush it off oh you got me! Ha ha and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro! more laughter. After we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. He said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. He said that by making that joke, all I have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. He wasn't mad, just disappointed. He said that he would never make fun of me if I had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me I was beautiful no matter what.  I felt really, really bad when he said that. I have apologized and things are fine now but I think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? Am I the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",

My family isn\u2019t broke, but we\u2019ve never had people working for us, and it made me super uncomfortable. Like, who am I to have someone serving me and cleaning around me while I sit there? I can\u2019t imagine if my mom were witnessing that. She\u2019d flip.  So I got up and started to help her tidy up. She thanked me for the help and told me I really didn\u2019t have to worry about it, but I told her it was no trouble (it really wasn\u2019t, we were just sitting watching TV.)  Later that night my girlfriend\u2019s parents asked me not to help the maid clean because it was a boundary thing and her work was her work and guests are guests. I told them it made me really uncomfortable to have someone clean around me and they just said not to worry because she\u2019s paid well and has been with them a long time.  The next day it happened again and it made me so uncomfortable I said \u201chey let\u2019s go outside\u201d to my girlfriend but she was busy on her laptop. So eventually I couldn\u2019t help it, I had to jump up and help her out.  Her parents walked in and looked pissed and my girlfriend finally clued in and ushered me outside.  I\u2019m still so confused by the situation. I\u2019m not sure if I was in the wrong for helping her clean or if I\u2019m in the wrong now for not helping her.

        "selftext": "Throwaway only cause I don't want this on my main. Ok so basically my husband and I are getting married later this year. Each of our sides of the family are fairly big. It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings. We have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fianc\u00e9 and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee.  So obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost. Well, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc. So AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?",

We have been dating for awhile now and she\u2019s always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn\u2019t eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn\u2019t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn\u2019t eat much since she\u2019s smaller but I didn\u2019t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can\u2019t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me\u2019s so often though since she\u2019s here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don\u2019t take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she\u2019s always making sure I\u2019m taken care of and comfortable. I don\u2019t know if I should just suck it up because she\u2019s not taking much from me and if I\u2019d be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA? Edit: wow.

The account name is based off a pretty popular band (Joyce Manor) I like so, I didn\u2019t think she would realize it was me. I\u2019m 26 and she\u2019s 20. Her name is not Joyce.

To my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.  My parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said I don't think so, I'm busy right now. I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up. He sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home. He was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable. We argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all. FYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story. Also it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink. Just sat down and watched.",

She takes pictures of food before we eat wether it's lunch or dinner and post them on her insta account. to be honest, I'm annoyed by having to wait so long for her to get the perfeft shot of the food after decorating it, adding this fork and removing that salad dish. It just takes so long and I lose my appetite from just waiting til she's done. This has become the norm but yesterday, I decided I was having none of it. I came to found that she has cooked an entire feast as her next cooking project and put it on the table. Note that by lokking at the whole table setting, I figured pictures had already been taken, right? but no, she said she was gOiNg to take few pictures and I had to wait. She went upstairs to get her camera that's when I grabbed the spoon and started filling my plate from every dish she's made and ruining the look as a result. I was hungry and unwilling to wait around for 10+ to eat. She came downstairs, saw the damage and blew up almost crying saying I just ruined her cooking project that she worked hours for as well as putting efforts into. I said I was hungry and couldn't wait but she kept yelling how much of an obnoxious jerk I was for not waiting til dhe took pictures of the dishes she made, Even said that this was an AttEmPt of me to Sabotage her success. I said oh please enough with those conspiracy theories, I'm just hungry and couldn't wait til she got the perfect shot. We had a big argument and shewent upstairs crying. I finished my food then went out to cool off a bit. When I returned she'd threatened that she'll never have me eat anything she cooks and said she'd rather throw it in the garbage then give it to a ungrateful, obnoxious jerk like me. I said this wasn't cool but she told me to go fuck myself. I said fine then went to spend the night in the guests room. she texted me the word jerk about 15 times til I turned my phone off. Today she has gone complete radio silence. AITA?",

We have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so I thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. My future wife and both of our families are Roman Catholic. Catholic ceremonies are *long*. I'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual getting married part. If you are not a believer, it is boring af. Hell, Im Catholic and I know I'll be bored for 80% of it. I thought I'll spare them the trouble. Anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying I forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. So I said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. She got confused, I explained and she got annoyed to say the least. Said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. I tried to explain again & fix things but I felt guilty the whole time.  Was it an asshole move? Edit: ah, I suppose I am TA. Just for clarification though: - we did explain things and they are coming to church. No hard feelings between us.  - those who I decided to spare expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to Christenings, First Communions & Confirmations) so I thought it translated to wedding ceremonies - i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of they invited me so i have to and ended up going wrong about it :/",

She'll breastfeed in front of us. Visiting our parents? She'll breastfeed. Going out in a public setting? She'll sit on a bench on the park and breastfeed. Go out to a restaurant? She breastfeeds. Every where. I've never spoken on it because I know she'll get mad and offended but when she did that on my wedding I lost my cool. During the reception dinner she just did it again. I kindly approached her and asked her why she didn't bring formula or at least bump milk out and put it in the bottle so she wouldn't have to do all this at that moment. She said because I don't have to. I feel comfortable breastfeeding. Getting milk out on my own is more painful I said she could just make this sacrifice and compromise for one day instead of doing this in front of 250 guests on my wedding. She then said she can't do much about it now, because the baby has to have her milk. I told her she should be more thoughtful of that then instead of completely embarrassing herself and us by doing this. I told my wife what the deal was and she said I'm an AH and should immediately apologise to my sister. My parents also sided with my sister and now pretty much everyone thinks I'm an AH since I'm the only person who had a problem with it. The only reason I decided to call her out is because I considered it a bad etiquette and tacky to do that at a formal event and that she could just find another solution for that night. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner. So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we\u2019ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it\u2019s become a great tradition in our social circle.  Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now. During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn\u2019t push the issue.  However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it.  My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don\u2019t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don\u2019t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",

So, I've always known my son had an interest in men. He was slow on the pick up of incognito mode, and from the searches he made, I figured he was at least Bi-curious (if that's the proper term for it) since he hit puberty. Well, last year, he started bringing a boy around, and it was obvious they were dating, to the point I figured that he knew I knew, and it wanst a big deal to anyone. Well, apparently, I was wrong. After school yesterday he and his boyfriend came up to me and said there was something really important they needed to tell me. My son said that they were dating and had been for a year. Well... I was surprised that he wasn't aware I knew and was a bit thrown off. My mouth moved faster than my brain and I said Well, thats pretty fucking gay. Now, I thought it was peak comedy, since it is infact gay. However, I understand using the word gay in that way gives it a very negative undertone, hence the mouth faster than brain comment.  Now my son and I are usually pretty edgy with our humor, this being fairly tame for the stuff we joke about. While probably not appropriate for the situation, it wasn't our norm for a conversation between us. However, he and his boyfriend were very, very upset and left.  I'm probably the asshole but I thought I would check, and see if yall had some advice on what I can say to fix it. He currently won't respond to my texts or calls. Iiiiii did not expect this to gain so much traction. It's a bit intimidating, lol. I am reading all the comments, though. Anyways, here is a small update - Hes at his grandparents' house, which I knew. He told them to tell me he'll be home tomorrow after school to talk. I'll update you all after the conversation.  Thank you for your responses. I really appreciate it.",

        "selftext": "So, I f31 recently got married to my husband Scott m36. Before I met him I was engaged to my former fiance Martin, but we broke it off because this relationship was sort of pushed by my family because he's a doctor and comes from a wealthy family. When our relationship ended mom was devastated. She did her best to bring us back together, For example she lied to Martin about me being pregnant to save us. That was years ago now we're all on good terms including Martin. Mom has a bit of tension towards Scott, she treats him well but constantly makes passive, nagging comments about him. She compares him to Martin all the time which bothers both of us but we try to let it slide. Mom kept telling Scott about the diamond ring, new car, and bank account Martin got for his fiancee and kept sending him photos saying how generous Martin is to his fiancee than compared him to Scott and what he had done for me. I told her stop doing this and she apologized. Last week, we were over at my parents house for a social gathering, lot of relatives came and we had dinner. At dinner table mom asked Scott if he saw the text she sent him the other day, he said he was sorry and that he didn't notice. She told him to check it right then and read it out loud so everyone at the table could hear. He took his phone and started reading the text out loud. Her text mentioned how Martin got his fiancee a new house and how generous he was, then said that Martin is younger than Scott, yet was able to buy a house. Basically shaming Scott for his inability to buy a house. She wrapped up by saying that Martin maybe wasn't so bad for me afterall. I was shocked and Scott was pissed obviously, however, he didn't lash out or anything he looked at the text, smiled and said you know, what gets me about this entire text is how you were a public educator for 30 years, yet you can't differentiate between the passive you and the contraction you're, Good God! The thought of all the children that must've been left behind!. Everyone at the table busted into laughter and mom's face went pale. She decided to leave the table then she and my sister started yelling at me saying Scott was being awfully rude and I need to get him to apologize immediately forembarrassing mom at the table. I refused to tell him to apologize then pointed out how she was being judgemental towards him, she defended herself saying she was just letting him know and he had no confidence and took it personally. I left but kept getting told to talk to him and get him to apologize for what he did.",

        "selftext": "My MIL has made a small family quilt for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home. She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered. I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little break and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt. I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side. But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?",

I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter. I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable.  My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money. We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that. We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French. I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US. She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this. She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way. We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons. AITA?",

My GF has beautiful hair that seems a lot more low maintenance than most women I know. She doesn\u2019t use all a hundred different hair products, nor does she blow dry it. It honestly doesn\u2019t take her long to style her hair or anything. However, she always insist on using this special towel to dry her hair.  She insists that she can\u2019t use any regular towel for her hair. She gets mad if I use her hair towel as a regular towel too. She says that the towel should only be used for hair. She even bought an extra one of these towels that she keeps in her drawer at my place. She also takes the towel with her when she goes on vacation.  I usually don\u2019t mind it, since the towel doesn\u2019t take up much space, and it better than listening to a hair dryer all the time. But it\u2019s a bit weird because I don\u2019t know anyone else who has a towel just for their hair.  For Thanksgiving, we travelled to see my family. Before the trip, I asked my GF to leave her towel at home since we\u2019ll be staying at my parents\u2019 house. I didn\u2019t want my family to think she was weird or make fun of her.  Since we planned to leave early in the morning, GF spent the night at my place. I noticed that she packed the towel she kept at my place in her suitcase. When she was asleep, I took the towel out. She didn\u2019t notice the towel was gone until after we got to my parent\u2019s house.  I thought it was okay, and my GF didn\u2019t seem mad at all during the whole trip. However, when we got back at my place, my GF got into her car and drove off without saying goodbye. She texted me later saying she\u2019s mad at me because of that stupid towel and she needs some space. I keep calling and texting her, but she won\u2019t respond.

When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby? I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves. **Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes. He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair. **Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion. **EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, in stained shirts and greasy hair. Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man. I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight. **EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin. I've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (I didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",

When I go out I wear a silicon padding on my left breast otherwise it looks very odd and makes me self conscious.  My boyfriend (23M) and I have been in a long distance relationship for the past 3 years. We had met a couple of times but we just enjoyed each other's company. He knows i am a cancer survivor but doesn't know about my breast. I decided to move in with him about a month ago and we tried to have sex.  I said tried because the moment he laid eyes on my breast his face went white and he refused to touch me further. He said I had cheated him and that I should have told him earlier about my breast. I told him that I didn't think it was important since he said he loves all of me and that he thought I was beautiful. I am honestly so conflicted right now and I feel like a horrible person. AITA for not telling my boyfriend that I don't have breast? Edit: Had a talk with him. He says he can't be with me anymore, he didn't know I was lacking a breast because I looked fine in my pictures.

        "selftext": "Lots and lots of ugly background here but I'll try not to wander. My wife I have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in May. I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years.  On Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing Army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and Aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. I climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where I assume the girl had usually sat. I told my son to knock it off and he said he would.  This morning I got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would confront me and my son Saturday morning. We sat down and it went from a calm this is something we're concerned about to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an adolescent sex ring in a matter of seconds. I tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and I've gotten them to stop. My wife asked if I planned on punishing him, I said that I don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. My neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. I told her that was really overkill. My wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and I asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. My wife has texted me that I am being incredibly irresponsible and if I don't do something she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. In all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend!  I guess that's about it...but am I the asshole for how I'm handling the issue with my son?",

I work for my dad\u2019s company and we had a presentation for clients Monday morning that I had to get ready for. My dad heard my wife was in labor but told me he needed me on this presentation. He said there was nothing I could do to help my wife and delivery and seeing the baby come out was overrated and people don\u2019t prepare your for the gore. He said he needed me to rest up and make myself presentable for the presentation. My wife\u2019s labor was progressing very slowly and we were all certain she would need forceps or other assistance to deliver the babies.  I realized that I couldn\u2019t help her here, and my dad was counting on me, so I told her I needed to leave. She started screaming at me so loudly that a few nurses rushed over to our room. I ended up doing the presentation with the clients and things went well. I leave the office and see a text on my phone that said my wife delivered an hour ago at around 10:30 am and they had to use forceps.  I would have missed the meeting had I stayed and my dad has given me everything he could possibly give me in life, so I didn\u2019t want to let him down.  AITA?

My girlfriend (34F) is a preschool teacher and for some reason I can\u2019t explain she dresses like Ms. Frizzle. Like a dress with the pattern of whatever they are studying. She makes a lot of them herself, now including matching masks. The kids love it, and the parents seem to think it\u2019s great. I don\u2019t like the amount of attention she gets honestly. I\u2019d prefer if she came home and changed before running any errands. On Friday, she helped my mom with something after work and she was still in her weird dress. I have told her before I don\u2019t like when she dresses that way, but she tells me I don\u2019t have to like it, but I have no right to tell her how to dress. I was upset she went out like that with my mother, and told her that my mom said she was embarrassed and to ask that she please not dress like that again if they\u2019re going out. I was not expecting her to call my mom and apologize. When my mom asked what she meant, she told her what I said. My mom was furious, explained she doesn\u2019t have a problem with how my girlfriend dresses and thinks it\u2019s great she spends extra time doing things to engage her students. My mom then yelled at me for lying to my girlfriend and trying to throw her under the bus because I was being an insecure jerk. My girlfriend and I got into a huge fight. I said she should be embarrassed to be seen in public like that. She said the only thing she was embarrassed by was me. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me or done anything for me since. My friend said I was horrible and called me trash. I shouldn\u2019t have lied, but I think my girlfriend should take what I think about her clothes into consideration and I\u2019m not sorry for expecting her dress more appropriately in public. Am I really such an asshole here? EDIT: I\u2019m sure you all will be pleased to know we broke up tonight. She said I\u2019m to controlling and narrow minded so she broke up with me.  ",

She cares about her appearance, and I appreciate that. So this situation makes no sense to me. We were at a very fancy event with a few of my friends (social distancing rules, every one wore masks etc.) My girlfriend was wearing a beautiful white dress, which I recently bought for her. The dress was very expensive.\u00a0 We were all having a good time. However, at one point, she excused herself to go the bathroom, and then I didn't see her again until she sent me a text from the car asking if we could go home. Obviously I'm slightly annoyed because I didn't want to leave so soon. When I reached the car and asked why she wanted to go home, she told me that she got her period unexpectedly. I asked why she didn't bring extra tampons or pads (or use those tracking apps) she tried to defend herself by saying that she did everything she could, and that she had a period stain, and didn't want to stay because of the stain.\u00a0 She asked me to lie to my friends, and tell them that she was feeling\u00a0 unwell so that she could go home. She had a man's jacket (a mutual friend of ours) covering her legs (and the nasty stain) and pleaded with me to take her home so she could shower and unwind. I took her home and lied to my friends. When she was getting out of the car, the stain was very noticeable, it was very big and essentially ruined an expensive dress which I bought. She also made me purposefully lie because she wasn't prepared enough, and made me miss an event with my friends. Needless to say, I was extremely pissed.\u00a0 She said I was not being considerate and went to go lie down because she had a headache (she wanted to lie down after she took a shower) She woke up and I haven't spoken to her properly until she apologizes, and gives back the friends jacket. I don't think I'm an AH, but when I told my friend (the same friend who gave her a jacket) he told me that I was the AH, and my GF kind of agreed. AITA? EDIT: I guess I'm the AH. I logged out of this account about an hour after posting because the response was terrible, and then came back to a TON of responses calling me the AH. After my girlfriend came home from returning the jacket, she apologized for ruining the dress and I apologized for being a dumbas and not understanding the whole 'period' thing. She forgave me, then we went out for ice cream and rewatched her favorite movie. That's the end of the story.",

I was working in a bar to make money while I explored his city.  When I got pregnant he lost interest really quickly. I understood but I am pro choice. And I chose not to terminate.  I went home and had my son. I also made sure to get child support. He could afford it. He did fight it though. I had to prove paternity and everything.  Through that his parents found out. They are well off. They have met my son and they truly do seem to love him. They have provided gifts for his birthday and Christmas. They helped me with extra money so I could complete my university without going into debt. They have taken us on vacation with them so they could spend time with him. They aren't my biggest fans but we are cordial to each other.  Three months ago my son's father passed away. He got drunk at his bachelor party, tripped on the sidewalk, and hit his head. And that was all she wrote.  My son and I attended the funeral. We spent a week in that city so his grandparents could see him.  They approached me with an offer. They had no other children or grandchildren. Their son was only 28 so he had lots of time to provide them legitimate kids (they did not say this I'm just assuming) so they never thought about my son's name.  They said that if I changed his surname to theirs legally they would make him their primary heir. I think this is dumb. He is their only grandchild and they would deny him an inheritance because of his last name?  I said I would consider it, to be polite, and have left it at that. I actually have a pretty good life as it is. My family has been very supportive. And because of the whole court thing my son's father had to have life insurance with him as the beneficiary.  Would it be nice for my kid to get a big sum of money. Yes. Do I want him to have the surname of a man who didn't want him, see him, or love him? No.  I have been talking to my family about it and a few of them think I'm being an asshole for giving up.this kind of money for my son. It is generational wealth and I'm making the decision based on emotion. I think they are assholes for thinking money is the only thing that matters.  I think I will tell my son's grandparents that they can talk to him about it when he is 16.

We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad.  Recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips.  I was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the mom went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for dad and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her. But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so.  My husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do. I feel like I was protecting the restaurant.

        "selftext": "My fiance (28f) is currently 5 months pregnant and has been both fatigued and nauseous lately. I get why she didn't want to help me look for the dog but I can't get over the lack of empathy and bordering selfish behavior of this either.  My dog (6yo Heeler/Corgi mix) runs off at least once a week. Usually my fiance will help me find her but it's not without protest. I honestly didn't even know how she was getting out of our fenced yard so I installed cameras and found that she was scaling the 8ft fence. I ended up attaching spinners to the top of the fence thinking that would solve the issue but it didn't. I brought her out today and was playing with her when my phone rang. I was inside just long enough to grab my phone and my dog had gotten out.  I immediately went in search for her, thinking she couldn't have gotten far but I couldn't find her anywhere so I went back to the house and asked my fiance, who was curled up on the sofa, to come help me. She immediately said no. She said she was tired of chasing the dog, that she isn't dealing with it anymore and that I should have been out there watching her. I explained to her that I had been watching her and simply stepped away for point two seconds to grab my phone just inside the sliding door and she had escaped. She again said it wasn't her problem and she's not exhausting herself anymore to search for my dog. I won't even say it was unexpected because as I said, in the past she has always had a problem with helping me search but she's never said no. She just complained about it.  At first I went and searched myself. After maybe a half hour I came back and asked her again to come help me and she snapped I said no! I am so tired of chasing that dog around multiple times a week when I'm already exhausted and throwing up constantly. I was panicked and unleashed some yelling, which involved me telling her she was a bitch who lacked empathy and that I was thoroughly disappointed with my decision to be with someone so heartless. It was out of pure fear and panic on my part and I did apologize later, after I found my dog, but she said Go fuck yourself and won't talk to me. AITA? Everyone is on my side except my sister, who says I'm a fucking prick because it's not my pregnant fiance's responsibility to chase around your fucking mutt and said she would have left immediately if her BF ever said what I did to her.",

But can be civil enough to sit at the same table. So, we went and had dinner and talked and everything was going well, no argument nothing til after my wife went to use the bathroom. Later my brother went to use the bathroom then came back looking pissed. He kept giving me and my wife looks but I didn't know what was going on til he pulled me aside before we left and told me that my wife had left her used pad in his bathroom. I was shocked and didn't know what to say because this felt highly inappropriate. He said he didn't appreciate what my wife did and that it was a sign of disrespect towards him. I apologized profoundly and said I didn't know about it. He asked me to speak to her or she wouldn't be welcome in his place anymore. We got in the car and I asked my wife about it, she nonchantly said there was nothing wrong with what she did and that my brother was being ridiculous. I kind of flipped and told her it was very inappropriate for her to leave her used pad in his place even if it was in the bathroom and in the trashcan because it made him uncomfortable. She yelled asking what she was supoosed to do and I told her she could've took it with her and threw it outside not in his bathroom -- that's my brother's place and he told me how he felt about it. She yelled at me calling my brother an incel and me an asshole for getting in her face about it. She said she needed to use the bathroom and it's not like the pad was vidible since she dumped it in the trashcan. At home we still argued about it and she kept on calling me and my brother names. She's currently not speaking to me and is avoiding me entirely. Regardless, I feel like it's his place and he gets to express what makes him uncomfortable in it. EDIT. I can't give info or expand on what was seen but I can tell you that the trash can does not have a lid. It's not like one of those trashcans that have a lid on top and you can push it. What I want to emphasize on is the fact that as guests we should respect people's homes and not argue about what makes them uncomfortable. He said it made him uncomfortable and that should, in my opinion, be acknowledged.",

My son and husband always turn up their noses at tofu or any other meat alternatives - they say it's just weird that it's made to resemble real meat, so it's really the concept and not the taste. There are no allergies. My family and I often make two versions of dinner - one meat, one real, and twice the amount of pots and pans. There is an equal distribution of cleaning and cooking in this house, thankfully. My daughters had a fun prank idea of making two pots of spaghetti sauce, under the pretense that one was meat (they were both the soy ground beef). The goal here was to see if their brother and father actually hated the meat and to see if we could maybe save some dishes and time (in the future). Everyone loved dinner, both husband and son finished their plates. This was when my youngest couldn't hold it in anymore and told them. They both got VERY upset about being fed something other than what they were told. Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready. The mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever. Regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed. Thing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up. I absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks. AITA?",

        "selftext": "(Throwaway because some of my family use Reddit.) Hi, all. I (F30) have been dealing with chronic medical issues all my life. I married my (33) husband, L, a few years ago and had my daughter A (5) soon after. When I was pregnant with A, I was warned that it would be difficult due to my issues and that she would likely have some passed on from me. I accepted this, and I expected it. She was delivered and was a beautiful baby girl who didn't have my issues at the time. However, as she got older, it became more apparent that she inherited my medical problems. One of which has an optional surgery that could negate it entirely. It's possible to live with it instead of choosing to operate, but the surgery will eliminate it. I have some trauma with hospitals in general. I've had to be in and out of them my entire life, and it's left some deep wounds. It's awful to spend your formative years stuck in a sterile room with an IV and in pain. I've spent some time in therapy for it, but I still hate them. The surgery that would remove the problem is covered by insurance, so money isn't a problem. However, it has a long recovery period, and I don't want my daughter to have to suffer through that. I've told L that I don't want her to have to go through the lengthy process of recovery. He disagrees and has asked my family members to knock some sense into me. (His words, not mine.) It's become a big point of contention between us, and I refuse to budge. So, AITA? Edit: For those who want to know, she has radioulnar synostosis in both arms. She'd have to spend weeks in casts with both arms. Edit 2: You are right. I was letting my own fear cloud my judgement. Thank you. Although, a bit rude to say that I should get sterilized, no? Edit 3: While I understand that I was undoubtedly TA here, it's disgusting how many people have written horrible comments, sent messages, and just been total jerks. You do not know me. I don't know you. This is ONE moment in my and your life, and I sincerely don't understand why you have to be so nasty about it. No, I will not sterilize myself. I will not kill myself, give up my child, or divorce my husband. I will not categorize myself as an abusive narcissistic sadist who hates my child and wants her to suffer like I have. I don't appreciate being psychoanalyzed by armchair psychiatrist Redditors.  To those who have respectfully put down their points, sent me kind messages, or just been supportive. I appreciate you all.",

My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave. A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking art and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). I'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I'm in the wrong here. I personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. I also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, I think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them.

Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her.  I'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me. Well, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks.  I wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic.  We went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that. She got mad and said she was making the best of her situation and said I was being insensitive, and she's been distant ever since. I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA?",

This concerns my oldest, I'll refer to her as 'Zara' We don't normally do big parties in our family after double digits (and 18th/21st), but Zara has been going through a bit of a difficult time so we decided to throw her a surprise party. This was yesterday. It was a big family party and Zara was enjoying it. Then the cake was brought out, I have a lot of young nieces and nephews so naturally they wanted to stand up with Zara, and she had no issue. When she went to blow out the candles, my 5 year old niece blew most of them out before her. Everyone laughed it off, my youngest actually put 23 candles on the cake and there were still a few lit, so I told Zara to blow those out. She did, but she looked angry and started crying. She then walked off. After that it got quite awkward and my sister (niece's mom) got upset/embarrassed, that her daughter is a kid and didn't mean to do it, and she didn't think Zara would act like this. We all calmed her down that it's not their fault. I talked to Zara and told her she was being a selfish brat and making a scene, she's 23 getting mad about birthday candles. She was still upset, and my other kids are telling me I wasn't being fair with Zara.",

        "selftext": "This is literally really stupid but she's really upset about it. So my (48) daughter (23) has a blue tongue skink who she heavily adores. She jokingly refers to it as her daughter, I've found it weird but she says it's because it's the closest thing she'd have to a child and she feels a strong emotional bond similar to a child. She has decided to remain child free for multiple reasons and I have been very supportive of this decision. Well she recently took her Skink to the vet for a checkup and she was excited to find out her Skinks gender. Afterwards I got a text asking if I'd come to her gender reveal party she was having. She explained it was just a small get together with cake and food for her friends she hasn't seen in a while with the gender reveal being mostly a joke (and a way to make fun of real gender reveals). Well I didn't come. I didn't see a point. It's just a lizard and I'm a busy person. She later called me and expressed she was kind of sad I didn't come cuz it'd been a while since I'd seen her but she understood I was busy. I told her she couldn't actually expect me to come to a gender reveal for a lizard. She said that it wasn't a real gender reveal, that was more of a joke and it was really just a small gathering to catch up with everyone. I told her if that was the case she should've just called it a gathering because I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter. She got quiet for a minute and then turned my words around, claiming I wasn't supportive of her decision to be childfree. I told her she can't possibly expect me to treat a lizard as a grand daughter, she said she didn't expect me too but it was clear I didn't respect her bond with her lizard and her decision, and she just wanted to see me and my reason for coming was hurtful. I told her she was being ridiculous over a lizard, she claimed it wasn't over the lizard and it was a gathering and not even centered around the lizard, but I stick by to what I said. It's ridiculous to have a gender reveal for a lizard. She hung up and I got a message from her best friend about how I'm an asshole for treating her that way, but I don't think I'm the asshole for not wanting to go to a party for a lizard?   EDIT: In the time I was away I got many replies and it was a lot to read through. Let me clear a couple things up. 1. My issue is that she said the party was a gender reveal, if she had called it just a party I would have come. But calling it a gender reveal makes it sound like it's for the lizard, and I'm not going to that even if it is a joke. 2. I don't know why it matters but the Skink is a girl which is why I said I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter. 3. Even though I don't agree with my daughter for being childfree, I have been supportive and only shown mild frustration. The reasons she decided to be childfree is she claims she's asexual, she just doesn't want one, she has emotional baggage and feels unable to care for a real child, she fears pregnancy, and she has a carrier gene like me and doesn't want to go through what I did (I had 4 miscarriages and a highly defect child that died after 3 months due to the gene). Yes there has been slight tension between us because I think she just hasn't found the right man (she never dated growing up) and her other fears are unnecessarily exaggerated, but it's ultimately her decision and I don't resent her.4. We haven't seen each other in three months. I'm a single mother and we have always been close which is why she invited me with her friends, I just didn't want to go to a party with a lizard, and if it wasn't for the lizard she should've called it a party instead of a gender reveal.",

I said it's not special treatmrnt but a tradition. Besides that he hurt her feelings for no reason other than for the sake of being malicious. He got offended and accused me of ruining his day and causing a scene. Now the family sided with him and said I shouldn't have left nomatter what.",

I then said it is a very normal joke to make and she disagreed. TLDR there was some back and forth, i asked her to drop it and she kept trying to talk about it. I said to her youre so insecure and she then goes does it make you feel good to call me that? so then I got really frustrated, got up, and walked out of the restaurant and drove home. She called me several times (I drove both of us there) but I was so frustrated and just wanted to get home so I turned my phone off. She showed up at our apartment 30min later and was really pissed called me an asshole and over reacted, and that she waited in the cold for 20 min for an uber.

I agreed although he did not consult me about it first. but I told him that he'll be his responsibilty not mine. He asked me to explain why and I told him it's because 1. he didn't consult me before taking his nephew in, and 2. I'm not equiped nor experienced in taking care/being committed to child care. I still have to cook and clean obviously. He said it was fine and that he'd be taking care of him on his own. The other day he called me in the afternoon saying he was stuck in a 2hr meeting and asked if I could go pick his nephew up from school. I said I was having lunch with mom and discussing family issues. He insisted but I reminded him that he said he'd be taking care of his nephew including school pickup/dropoff. I suggested he try to get off work or call some family member to go pick him up. He tried to argue but I hung up. I went home at 3 and surprisinglyfound my husband there. He was angry he started yelling at me calling me selfish and unfeeling. I told him that his lack of mamagement wasn't my fault. he yelled saying that my lunch with mom could've fucking waited but I chose to be fucking petty just to prove a point. I said that wasn't true and told him to get over himself and stop acting like he was the victim when he put himself in this situation knowing he wouldn't commit. He yelled that ge was trying to do all he can to help his brother out but it was me who's playing victim after I refused to help out. We argued some more and I ended up going to stay with my mom for the night. He texted me some choice words that's when I turned my phone off. We're still arguing about it.",

Beth had issues with her father growing up. She went no contact with him after he took her first car and damaged it. She only remained in contact with Mike since everybody else judged her for going no contact. She's getting married to her fiance of 3 years. From what I understand, she and her dad are slowly getting reconciled, but she made it clear she wants him to take no part in the wedding. She asked Mike if he could walk her down the aisle and he agreed. I have to say that I was taken aback and it felt a bit odd for me because, her dad is alive, they're on speaking terms again, he's gonna be there at the wedding so the logical thing to do is have him walk her down the aisle. This role isn't for her older brother but her father. Not to mention how FIL will feel about it. I brought this up with Beth and she had an attitude and implied that I was just saying this and objecting because of how I feel about the situation not how our traditions should be practiced. We got into an argument and I went home. Mike thinks I'm being unreasonable and possibly causing him to miss something so sentimental and that if anything, he feels honored to be asked to do this for her, and said that I should stop worrying about what others might say.

I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back. Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down.  Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject. When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my friend versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want? **EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed... But the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",

Over that time my friends circle got considerably smaller but my best friend remained, Mia (f31). Mia doesn\u2019t have kids nor wants kids but she\u2019s been brilliant with Ciara. I\u2019m a SAHM and obviously don\u2019t have as much time to hang out as I did previously. Mia and I live on the same street (we\u2019re in Manchester, England) and it\u2019s a walking distance between our houses. I\u2019ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does.  She did at the beginning but it\u2019s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don\u2019t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we\u2019ll have coffee at my place. She asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she\u2019s welcome to come over and we\u2019ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there\u2019s a child around.  Honestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. I\u2019m always available but she rarely comes over and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. Today, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn\u2019t value me when she won\u2019t even have a few drinks with me at my house. When she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble \u201clike always.\u201d This really annoyed me. When she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she\u2019s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around. She said she\u2019s always been accommodating but it\u2019s been 2 years and she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me when there\u2019s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear). I said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off. This felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage.  I was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out. Normally, I would expect her to call by now with apologies but she hasn\u2019t done so and I\u2019m starting to wonder was I the asshole or was she? Perhaps I was too harsh and should\u2019ve been more careful with discussing it.",

It turns out she doesn't have any children so I found it strange she bought a 3 bedroom house but I soon found out it's because she runs a craft business from home and needs 2 bedrooms to run it. The problem is unfortunately she has decided to use to main bedroom, which is below us as her main craft room.  At first it was fine as she hadn't fully moved in but now it's driving me crazy. She's in that room almost all day and I can hear her walking about and the faint noise of machines. I don't spend long in my bedroom during the day but when I do go in it just annoys me knowing she's there constantly. Like why can't she have picked the smaller bedrooms since she knows the kids are at school all day? She always stops using her embroidery and sewing machines by 7pm but she's told me she can sit up until 10pm some nights finishing off orders which plays on my mind. I go to bed at 9pm and I can't sleep for hours as I lie there listening for her every move. Just knowing she's awake and walking about drives me crazy as I find it so selfish someone would buy a flat and work from home.  My husband says he can barely hear a thing during the day and I need to calm down. He also doesn't see the big deal about her using her house as she pleases. Yesterday I finally had enough and went to her door. I told her how I was feeling about everything and how I can hear the faint noise of her machines. She apologized and invited me inside to show me her set up. All her machines are on some sort of anti vibration padding to stop as much noise as possible so she claims the noise should be minimal and that you need to expect some noise from neighbours. I told her I don't make any noise and that's when things took a turn as she said she can hear my kids running around and jumping off furniture all evening but she would never dream of complaining because it's just one of those things when you share a building with other people. I left before I said anything else I regretted and I thought that was the end of it but today my husband came home from working overnight and asked if I had said anything to the woman downstairs as she was very cold and blunt with him when he said hello. I told him what happened and he said I'm a massive asshole. I've spoken to a couple of my friends who think I've handled this completely wrong and I'm a bit of an asshole for it but I don't see what else I could have done",

I always check in on my son remotely via our nursery cam app and he's always awake in the mornings around 8:00. He has a great sleep routine. Our wind down time starts at the same time every evening, we clean up toys, read a book, when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and sleeps all night for at least twelve hours. It's usually after 9:00 before I have a chance to check the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and some mornings are closer to 10:00. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting. When I see this, I immediately turn on the brightest night light the camera has and speak to him through the camera app. I always tell him good morning and I love him and he usually laughs and says Dada. Then I leave the app and call my wife to wake her up. I usually have to call three to four times and when she finally answers, it's obvious that she just woke up and only because I called. I tell her that our son is awake waiting for her and that she needs to get up to start their day. This morning while on the phone, I asked her if she was going to get him after using the bathroom and she said no, she was going to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast and THEN she'd get him. I asked her to get him after the bathroom so he could go to the kitchen with her and she flipped out. She told me it pisses her off that I call EVERY morning to tell her how to be a mom and that she has a routine. I retorted with well, your routine sucks because he's been awake for an hour and you'd still be asleep if I hadn't called. I just bothers me that he has to wait so long. He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play. Am I wrong though? Do I need to stop? Please be completely honest with your answers. Thanks!  **EDIT #1**  I was banned from commenting within the first hour because I violated a rule in a comment and that's why I wasn't responding to anyone. I'm a fairly new Reddit user in terms of posting - I normally read a lot and that's all - and because of this, I had no clue that a temporary comment ban didn't affect my ability to edit the post. I would have edited the post much sooner had I known I was able to regardless of the comment ban. There are so many things that need to be addressed about this post and the most important one is about my wife. I love her more than anyone on Reddit thinks I do. She is an amazing woman and a wonderful mother. I absolutely DO NOT think she is an incompetent parent nor do I think she neglects my son. None of the information I provided was ever supposed to convey that negative message about her. My whole issue was: he's awake, he's been awake, why are you still asleep? - that's all, and she agreed she stays up too late plus has alarms set now. I showed my wife how this post EXPLODED and she COULD NOT believe the kind of attention it got. She is very much in love with me and does not agree that I am controlling nor does she believe that I am micromanaging her daily life. Also, because so many people believe that I intentionally left out the medical issues she has, I'll list them here: - postpartum depression- low vitamin B-12- chronic fatigue Now, let me explain why I didn't list them originally. Her low vitamin B-12 is not a deficiency, her level is just lower than what is considered best for her age; this is according to recent bloodwork that I recommended. The results state that any number between 100 pg/mL and 914 pg/mL is within normal range, and her level is 253 pg/mL. The doctor suggested sublingual B-12 1000mcg daily to raise the level a little, but stated that apart from that, she could not find a reason for the chronic fatigue. Because of these results, and especially after purchasing the supplements, in my mind, the B-12 is not a problem. Also, the bloodwork confirmed that everything else was normal. The postpartum depression is actively being monitored and treated by a professional. My wife literally goes to a psychiatrist, or psychologist (I can't remember their exact title) multiple times a year and we pay for medication every 30 days. She initially tried depression medication, followed the regimen religiously and not much changed for her. This was addressed in a following appointment and a new medication was prescribed. Her current medication is normally used to treat ADHD or narcolepsy and the doctor believed it would alleviate some of her tiredness and release more dopamine thus providing more energy in her daily life. This does seem to be true and she seems to be happy with the medicine. The chronic fatigue is a result of her own poor scheduling and personal health. She has agreed that she spends too much time sitting and using the phone. She naps when our son naps and has trouble falling asleep at a normal bedtime hour due to this daytime sleep. We always go to bed together and he's told me multiple times that she moved to the living room after I fell asleep because she couldn't sleep and was bored just lying there. Then, midnight or later comes, she's finally drowsy and decides to sleep. However, the overstimulation from social media and phone usage makes it difficult for her brain to reach REM sleep normally. So she falls asleep at 12:00, our son wakes up at 8:00, eight hours have passed and she still feels tired and not at all rested. I do know and have known about her condition. We have agreed to disagree about the cause of her sleeping problems. In her mind she has chronic fatigue because of insomnia and it's a vicious cycle. In my mind she stays up too late on the phone and doesn't get the sleep her body needs. Whether the internet thinks she is a bad mother, negligent, lazy or abusive is not important. I know and love the woman I married, I do feel comfortable leaving her with our kid and she does an amazing job with him. In a few comments I stated that she was lazy and didn't do much at home. I won't deny those statements, but in the moment I was still aggravated because the argument over the phone had just recently ended. I don't truly think she's lazy because I've seen what she can do; I just think she's unmotivated due to a lack of sleep and the same four walls every day. Finally, I am not spying on her or my son. We only have two cameras in this house and both are in our son's room. One camera provides a wide-angle view of the entire room and the other is positioned directly above his crib. The cameras serve no purpose during the day because I'd barely be able to hear background noise from another room even if I did try to listen in. My wife is an amazing woman and an amazing mother. My son is just so happy all the time, he's super smart, full of energy and extremely healthy. I will not be hiring a nanny or using a daycare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what my wife does during the day, I just wish she'd start her day earlier for my little man. I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post and messaged me. My wife and I had a long, in-depth conversation last night after all of the attention this post received and I've shown her everything. There were tears, much more laughs and a lot of things to think about. I think the most important thing we learned is that so many people are quick to judge and that in itself is a very big problem.  **EDIT #2**  I need to make it clear that my wife does not have narcolepsy. She is not taking medicine for narcolepsy. I said that the medicine she takes now is USUALLY used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. She also does not have ADHD. The second thing we learned is that people love to add details and change the story.",

        "selftext": "My (26F) sister Anna (24F) married my friend Lance (27M), he was the cool guy in our friend group, handsome, misterious, smart, quiet. I don't know how he ended up with my sister, she's the total opposite, loud, funny, outgoing. She's beautiful tho, really beautiful, and when they got together everyone said how good they looked. Anna seemed to be really in love with him ALL THE TIME, she used to say how dreamy he was, how good he treated her and how spoiled she felt, but Lance was always so stern and quiet, she would revolve around him at family gatherings but he wouldn't engage that much with everyone but me and her. I was surprised when he asked her to marry him.My sister never took the wifey role too serious, she had a non-traditional wedding and Lance when along with it, she made a bunch of rules that he agreed to and then they moved to his house. Anna banned house utensils from the wedding gift list, she doesn't work, didn't finish her studies and they don't plan on having kids. My sister is pretty much only into her looks (And I didn't think Lance cared for that before), she's always on Snapchat or Instagram, I thought that after getting married she would dress more appropriate since she used to use crop tops, blouses, dresses and shirts that showed her cleavage, short skirts or tight jean, but she says that Lance likes her just fine. Last week was my dad's birthday and we had a party, my sister and Lance came and she was wearing a pretty short floral dress, nonetheless most of the men were looking at her including my dad's friends, Lance was as stoic as always and my sister came to my mom and I and saying that she didn't know why he was so quiet since he's not like that (HE is like that wtf) so I told her that if she didn't dressed like that he might take her more seriously. She got sad and sat quietly the rest of the night and I didn't think much of that, but a few days ago Lance texted me and said that he would appreciate if I didn't comment on her wife's way of dressing again. ??? Did I miss something? IM NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM",

        "selftext": "My daughter and I were recently on vacation. We spent the day in an area that\u2019s known to have a lot of rich/famous people and towards the end of the day we saw one of my daughter\u2019s favorite celebrities (we\u2019ll call her A) walking out of a store.  My daughter ran to the store but when she got near A, she was stopped by A\u2019s security. They said that A\u2019s there with her daughter for her daughter\u2019s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter.  My daughter was very upset because she\u2019s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away.  My daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn\u2019t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn\u2019t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.  The post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter\u2019s birthday for everyone that wants a picture.  My husband also saw the post and said he couldn\u2019t believe that I would bash her for trying to spend the day with her daughter. I\u2019m not trying to bash her for spending the day with her daughter but she wouldn\u2019t be where she is without her fans so I think she at least owes it to them to take a picture.

        "selftext": "Sis is 28 I'm 26M.  My sis N has always had a strained relationship with our parents especially my mom. I am clearly not privy to the reasons because things are fine with me and my parents. When N went to college she met her creative writing professor as a freshman and they got close immediately. They would do a lot together and worked closely on a few different writing projects. N never specifically said this, but it was obvious to anyone who saw them interact that they had a substitute mother/daughter type relationship. Which hurt my mom a lot to see. I always thought she'd grow out of it or that the prof would move on but ten years later they were still very close.  About a month ago the prof died unexpectedly and it devastated N. She was really dperessed over the holidays which of course was all in front of my mom and was a difficult reminder that N loved the prof as a mother way more than she ever loved my mom as a mother. She still talks to my parents and stuff and they don't fight or anything but N is very distant and doesn't tell them anything about her life beyond the bare minimum. My mom tried to comfort N but N was doing her distant thing and didn't want comfort.  Something unfortunate that happened to N is that when she got the call that she died, she was brewing tea and in the shock of the news she spilled boiling water on her arm which burned her kinda badly on her wrist. I think the burn was like on the borderline of 2nd and 3rd degree, and definitely still looked pretty rough during the holidays. N said it was especially hard because in addition to the physical pain, every time she looks at it she is reminded of the moment she found out the prof died. Which I totally get. I was on facetime with N and she said she talked to her tattoo artist friend who said that the burn should be able to heal well enough to get a tattoo over it. N then excitedly told me about her idea which is a type of flower that the prof gave her a bouquet of for her undergrad graduation. My mom was so embarrassed that day because she didn't get N flowers but the prof did and N was parading them around so happy and it was a reminder of their connection. I guess N and the prof exchanged these flowers for every special occasion like birthdays etc. So now she wants to get a decent sized tattoo in a highly visible spot of something that will remind everyone of the prof. I told N that this seemed really cruel to my mom who already feels cast aside and like she's in exile from N. And that's without the constant permanent reminder. N kind of scoffed and said I can't believe you think you have the right to tell me not to do this, called me an ass and hung up and is still not talking to me except for a very brief text saying congrats for a promotion I just got. My parents aren't commenting. My dad said I should have just kept quiet even though he agrees and my mom made no comment but seemed grateful I stood up for her. I feel like I was just being protective of my mom. But AITA?",

When I met my fianc\u00e9, he was at my house to supervise a roofing crew the insurance company hired to replace my damaged roof. I instantly fell for him when he pulled up in his truck and couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of him for the rest of the day as he gave orders to his men. When we started dating, he was vague about his job and I just chalked it up to him being insecure about me having a better career. I didn\u2019t care about our income imbalance. When we got serious, we talked about our future plans and that was when he told me the full extent of his little construction company. I was shocked that his construction earnings is as much as my dad\u2019s surgeon salary. Gradually he took me around to the handful of construction lots and shopping centers he owns. His rental income combined with his construction earnings is double that of my dad\u2019s. He said that few people know about his finances and he expects me to keep what I know to myself. My parents disapproved of him since the 1st time I brought him home. My dad coined the term \u201ctool boy\u201d and the rest of my family joined in whenever they talk behind my fianc\u00e9\u2019s back. They don\u2019t call him that to his face but instead make snide remarks. Once my mom said during dinner that they\u2019re thinking about hiring someone to mow their lawn then turned to my fianc\u00e9 and asked him what he charges. I always try to defend him and it\u2019s a constant battle. It\u2019s gotten worse since we\u2019re planning our wedding and the other day my nerves just broke. Yesterday parents were trying to get me into getting a prenuptial then my dad said, \u201cyou have to protect your assets just in case tool boy decides to go slumming.\u201d I lost it and yelled at my parents. During our shouting, I blurted out his earnings and that he makes more than both of them combined then I stormed out. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened but instead of supporting me, he got mad that I told his parents that. I argued that I was defending him then we got into an argument. My parents and family are mad at me for keeping secrets. My fianc\u00e9 is mad at me for not keeping secrets. I\u2019m stuck in the middle and don\u2019t know what to do.",

Yesterday, we were visiting my family because we won't be able to be with them on Christmas, so we wanted to drop off some presents. It was also the first time that my boyfriend met my entire family, so it was kinda important. Here's the thing, I forgot to tell them that my boyfriend is vegetarian, so my mom made a turkey and there wasn't really anything else to eat, beside some snacks. When I realized that, I quietly asked my boyfriend to please not cause a scene, and just eat the food and compliment my mom on it. He tried to argue back, saying that he doesn't wants to lie to my mom but I told him he would come across as rude if he didn't atleast tried it, and I didn't wanted him to make a bad impression. So he sucked it up, ate an entire plate and told my mom that it was delicious, which obviously made her happy. We had a good evening and everyone seemed to like him, but when we drove back home he brought it up again and said he thinks it was kinda fucked up of me to expect him to eat meat, when I know how much it disgusts him. I get his point and I apologized to him, bit I still don't think that it's *that bad* to eat a bit of turkey once, to not make a weird first impression on my family. AITA? edit: a few people are asking why there was nothing else that he could've eaten and like I said, there were of course some other snacks and a couple of different sauces, but nothing that would've been considered a decent meal without the turkey.

She was super excited since I guess you would call her a superfan. I definitely feel like she's too old to put so much stock in kpop, but I generally don't talk to her about it, since it's pretty harmless, just annoying. She was told that she could bring a plus one with her to the station to meet the band, and so she took me with her. Even in the car, she was so excited that she was shaking, and she kept saying that she wasn't sure she could do it. (I didn't care either way, I wanted it over with!) The meeting was honestly nothing special, all the band members said hi to her and shook her hand or offered her like a platonic hug. She cried for most of it (awkward) and kept bowing to the members (she's white) and while I didn't say anything, I was SO embarrassed for her. Some of the guys also shook my hand and greeted me, but a few of them didn't, probably noticing that I wasn't really into it. Whatever, it wasn't for me it was for her, I'm not a fan. She has some other friends who are also kpop fans, and when we all hung out later, she started talking about how wonderful and surreal it was to meet her idols. I then started laughing and telling her friends about how awkward she was, how she bowed to all of them despite none of them bowing to her, and made a joke about how they probably laughed at her once she was out of earshot. Complete silence, immediately everyone is death glaring at me. I try to clarify that she really was acting CRAZY for a 23 year old (I even looked up the band and half of them are teenagers!) and she retaliates that she probably made them feel less awkward than me, who didn't even talk to them. What the fuck, was I supposed to talk to a bunch of Korean guys I don't know? We ended up arguing about it privately but it's been a sore spot and we just don't bring it up. She barely even listens to kpop around me now. Fast forward to now, a year-ish later. My girlfriend just bought 2 NCT tickets for her and her friend, which were very expensive and include YET ANOTHER fan meet. I mention buying a ticket myself so I can go along with them (not to the fanmeet though) and my girlfriend said she'd rather me not go because she doesn't want me to be bored or embarrassed. The way she said it was so cold, for absolutely no reason, and I feel like she's being so passive aggressive over a joke that I made AGES ago.

We know that moving into a new home always comes with unexpected costs, right after you've probably depleted most of your funds. So, for Christmas we gave her $4000. Our son we gave a few different gifts totaling somewhere around $800. Our daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him. My wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive. He said that was all fine and good, but it still hurt to get a worse present and feel like an afterthought. My wife asked if he expected us to get him four thousand dollars worth of gifts. He said no, but he expected the gifts between him and his sister to be equal. My wife said that's the same thing, and my son said it isn't. He said we could have given her the monetary equivalent of what we gave him. I told him that it isn't really fair for him to decide how much we spend on someone else's gift. Furthermore, cash is less personal than gifts, so giving her a cash equivalent to what he got would be her getting the worse gift. He said we weren't listening to him, just justifying. My wife said we didn't need to justify anything, and he was being entitled. At that point he said he didn't want to talk unless everyone was civil and he went to his room. He skipped lunch (breakfast for him) today, and when he left for work he didn't say goodbye even though I was right by the door. My wife is irritated, and my son is clearly resenting us. I can't really decide if we're in the wrong here. On the one hand, we should be able to give our money to whoever we want. On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings. Were we wrong?",

Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies).  On Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes.  When I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art.  My niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, really ugly and made her uncomfortable. Surprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.",

        "selftext": "I met my wife in my early 30s. She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage.  So when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical. So she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I\u2019m not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style. A couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend\u2019s husband. Divorced obviously followed. The only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country.  Now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I\u2019d have no problem paying what\u2019s fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent.  So in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay. So here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it\u2019s taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments. Now she has no legal recourse (I\u2019ve double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states. The reason I\u2019m asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",

I've been embarrassed about it in the past. our oldest rode the school bus for the first time. my wife was waiting at the stop with our daughter and had her hand the bus driver a bag of homemade cookies. then when she picked her up from the stop in the afternoon, she gave a bag to the afternoon driver. I asked why she did that when she could easily have just said thank you and left it at that. she said the bus drivers work so hard having to comfort all the nervous kids and handling the unbehaved one while driving they deserve more than a thanks. I reminded her that this has embarrassed me in the past and I think her behaviors are too extreme. I wouldn't want gifts from someone I don't know. she ignored how I felt. I contacted some people in my life to see if I was just the crazy one here and most of my friends and my mom agree, my wife's way of showing thanks just makes everyone uncomfortable.  AITA?",

We were out at the diner last night and I asked my husband for his phone to check payment options for our meal. I unlocked the screen and saw my son's pic set as the homescreen wallpaper. I asked my husband how long it's been there and he said 2 months. I got upset and pointed out that it was not wise of him to use a pic of my son as his homescreen wallpaper for strangers to see. He said pretty much, almost no one touches his phone so I shouldn't worry about my son's pic seen by strangers. I told him they don't have to touch his phone to see his iphone homescreen. he said I should relax because it's not like he posted it on social media and besides that he only used my son's pic as his homescreen wallpaper to be able to look at him all the time because he misses him when he's at work. I demanded he remove it but he said no. I insisted and an argument ensued to the point where I got up, paid my part of the bill then walked out of the restaurant. He decided to stay at a hotel because he was overwhelmed and texted me about how deeply I hurt him and told me he removed the picture entirely from his phone if that would make me happy. then went on to say I overreacted and by the looks of it, he's expecting an apology from ME!! after what happened. was ITA or was he?",

We had a daughter who is 16, a son who is 13 and a daughter who is 5. He's always been a good dad, and we split 50/50 custody, essentially the kids one week my house/one week his house. After my divorce, I reconnected with a high school boyfriend and fell head over heels in love again. He's in the military but hadn't had to move in years. We married 2 years ago.  A year ago, he got orders to move to Texas from where we all were in California. My older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. I approached my ex and told him the situation. I said I know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. He blew his top and said absolutely not, I wouldn't take his kids away and said he'd see me in court. The judge ended up ruling in his favor, and I was awarded summers and every other holiday. I was absolutely devastated. I moved, and I've barely seen the kids since. They came at Christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. The older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on FaceTime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much. My daughter has said I chose a man over her, and that she wants nothing to do with me, while my son won't talk about it but I can tell he's angry.  I've asked my ex to talk to them about it and he basically said I chose to leave, it's my fault and he's not getting involved in our issues. So, let me have it Reddit, AITA?",

        "selftext": "So this month I was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which I had booked and seats selected for. I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat \u2014 just the aisle and window.  Well, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he\u2019s even attempting to board. I\u2019m mentally crossing my fingers he\u2019s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in.  I get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him: \u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry but this situation is not working for me, you\u2019re taking up quite a bit of my seat\u201d.  He wasn\u2019t rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there\u2019s not nothing he can do \u2014 although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn\u2019t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I\u2019m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat.  I end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren\u2019t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn\u2019t a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence.  The guy seemed embarrassed and didn\u2019t want to get up. He mentioned how he can\u2019t wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight \u2014 the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he\u2019ll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here\u2019s where I made my offer.  I told the guy, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll put up with this if you give me $150 \u2014 that\u2019s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.\u201d He instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it.  Well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn\u2019t volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet.  From my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person\u2019s body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn\u2019t angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately.  After the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but I ignored them. This leads me to beg the question, AITA? ",

        "selftext": "My (48M) daughter (21F), Aria, abandoned us (her stepmother, younger half-sister and me) when she was 15 to go live with my enabling ex-wife, Sandra, and her husband. Until then, we had 50/50 custody, but Sandra has always been less strict than me. She's always let Aria do what she wants and has never had any home rules. She also buys Aria everything she wants so she will want to live with her.  Sandra lives in the same town where Aria's highschool was, while I live 25 mins away. So, one of my rules was that if she went to meet up with a friend there (meaning I had to drive her), the next time they met it was her friend's turn to come. If the friend's parents didn't want to drive the kid here, then Aria wasn't allowed to meet them again while she was with me. Everything was fine that way for years.  The major fallout happened in her last year of highschool (she was 15). She went on a trip to another country with her school and didn't bother to send more than a couple texts when she was away for 5 days. So I decided to ground her, because she had to learn to respect and show some love for her family. She insisted she had sent messages to her mother but we had barely heard from her.\u00a0 She's never had a lot of friends, but she had been invited her to some popular girl's birthday party. This was my punishment, not going to that party after forgetting about her family. She got upset and started calling her mother to come pick her up, but it was illegal to get her if it was my week. Plus, she wanted to go to her mother's because she would lift my punishment and let her go to the party. Her mother came by the end of the week and I told Aria that she didn't have to come back if she didn't want to. I waited, but I heard nothing from her again. Her sister kept asking me why she didn't come back, and I didn't know how to explain to her that she didn't love us and that she preferred staying with her mother, her parties and her free-of-rules life. Over the years we've communicated through lawyers, because Sandra has 0 intentions on helping me get my daughter back (she finally has her to herself). They've been demanding that I pay for child support, even now that she's 21 years old. I have to pay for that and for half of her college expenses (by law). When Aria turned 18, an adult, I started adding up everything I had to pay in an Excel that I send to Sandra when I update it so she knows what damage she is doing to our daughter (I expect Aria to pay her debt, but I gave Sandra the option to pay for her to which she refused). We are now at 18K. Aria has been trying to get in touch again. I told her that we can't fix the emotional part unless we fix the money part first. She needs to prove to me that she doesn't only care about the money. Sandra says I'm an asshole but I think she is, since she has done nothing but try to take my daughter away and she finally has what she wants. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I(M32) have a daughter Harper(F14) from a previous relationship. I have full custody and her mom is not involved in her life.  5 years ago I married my wife Nina(F31) we tried to have a child but couldn't. We went to the doctor and turned out I can't have anymore kids due to some complications. We decided to use an sperm donor and the result was a son, Mark, who was born a few months ago.  The problems started when Nina got pregnant. Harper wasn't happy about it. When Mark was born things got worse. Before this Harper and I used to spend 2 days a week together, just the 2 of us without my wife but after Mark was born I couldn't do that anymore. I can't just leave my wife alone for 2 days a week with a newborn and Harper has been very angry about it.  The main problem started 3 days ago. Nina and I decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in our bedroom for multiple reasons.  Our home has 4 bedrooms, 2 master bedrooms at one side and 2 bedrooms at the other side. One of the master rooms is ours, the other one is Harpers. It was very hard for Nina and I to go to the other side of the home multiple times at night when Mark wakes up so I asked Harper pack her stuff and go to one of the bedrooms so that we could give her room to Mark. At first everything seemed alright. She said ok and went to her room and started packing but less than an hour later my brother showed up at our home, asking for Harper. She had called him and asked him to take her. She came out of her room with her stuff, told me you can give it to your son now and left with my brother. I told her she could only go for one night but it has been 3 days and she is not back and wont even talk to me.  Im receiving calls from my family all calling me an AH and other names.  I dont trust their judgement, they very clearly favor Harper. She was the first grandchild in our family and everyone's favorite also they are trying to accept Mark as my son but I could see that they haven't been able yet so I decided to post here and get some unbiased opinions. AITA? Edit: Here is the update that I promised  I realized I've messed up so I went to my brothers home and tried to get Harper back but he didn't even let me see her, saying she doesn't want to see me.  He said he would only let her go back if:  1. She wanted to go with me  2. We move to another home close to their home because they wanted to have Harper close to them to keep an eye on her and make sure we are treating her right, we used to live very close to them but when I got married my wife and family didn't get along so we moved somewhere farther away which made Harper very sad.  3. Harper will get to choose which bedroom she wants in our new home  4. I should spend 1 on 1 time with Harper at least one day a week  Which I accepted.  This caused a lot of problems since my wife doesn't like some of those conditions. she thinks they are not reasonable. She got angry, took Mark and went to her parents home and is staying there so now I'm also receiving texts from my inlaws calling me an AH.  Right now Im looking for a new home that is closer to my brother's home  I called Harper and my brother convinced her to talk to me for once. she was crying the whole time while telling me that she felt like I didn't want her anymore. Hearing her cry like that really broke my heart. I honestly never meant to hurt her.  After so many apologies and gifts she finally agreed to see me. I will go to my brother's home everyday to spend time with Her. She has also finally agreed to come home with me when I find a new home.",

The day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad. I told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that. I told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room.  She then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not.  I held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted.

She cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. She always goes to the same coffee shop.  Me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. She always says the guy who serves her coffee is beautiful, she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. That was fine.  Anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. I trust her ENTIRELY, I know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything.  Anyway, I went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. I ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and I shit you not he said oh is that for Emma? And when I looked shocked he went I just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it. I said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. The guy kinda laughed and i said that I appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, I think he was flirting. He laughed again and said sure thing.  I didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare I embarrass her like that. This pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! She said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. Fair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay.  She stormed out and still won't speak to me without making sly digs.  AITA?  **Tl;Dr** told the barista that my gf wasn't single and was with me as I thought they were flirting.",

        "selftext": "Last fall, my husband and I went to my cousin's wedding in another state.  In the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs.  We traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera.  The day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding.  My husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals.  I noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast.  So we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding.  TBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation. But I still have to ask. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My daughter just turned 6. We had a birthday party for her on Saturday. That morning was pretty hectic. I was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and I didn't notice. All that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as Sarah and it's Sara and I said, who cares, just scrape off the H but she insisted on returning it. So I said fine whatever. And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations.  And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, what's the most important thing? She says the gift bags. I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them. My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says dont worry, dad made them and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified What the fuck is this? she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over goodbye duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter. Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me those are dog poop bags and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party. well, reddit, they dont look like dog poop bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore. So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week. So, Reddit, AITA? TL;DR: I used dog poop bags as goody bags by accident for 6 year old daughter's bday party",

Since we met via Skyrim, I thought I would promise with the amulet of Mara, which is the symbol that someone is ready for marriage. She doesn\u2019t really wear jewelry or anything and has never shown me a ring she likes when we\u2019ve talked about marriage so I thought it\u2019d be sweet to have something that brought us together.  I set up this whole picnic with our favorite things and when I proposed, she looked sad and asked about a ring. I told her I thought the amulet of Mara was sweet because we met via Skyrim.  The other day she sat me down and said she thought the amulet was very sweet and she liked it, but she wanted to go ring shopping. I told her I had already bought the necklace and I didn\u2019t see any reason for a ring since I didn\u2019t propose with one. She said she appreciated the sweet gesture but she really wanted a traditional ring.  We got in an argument and it\u2019s been tense the last few days.  AITA? Update: we talked. I bought her a ring.

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)I will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.This all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.I told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.She was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.). Am I being the asshole here? EDIT:Here\u2019s an update, for people who wanted it.

        "selftext": "My late wife Kate passed away about 12 years ago. They have a family heirloom that has passed down several generations (starting from her great grandmother) from mothers to their first daughters, on their 18th (or thereabouts) birthdays. The heirloom itself is not highly valuable in a financial sense, but the history makes it very valuable to the people in the family. I currently possess it after Kate passed away and I always intended to give it to my daughter, Claire, on her 18th birthday. She is currently 16. I married my current wife about 8 years ago. My step daughter, Sarah, (whom I have adopted and consider my own daughter) is 17 years and 11 months old, her 18th birthday is in a month. My wife has also adopted Claire and we all consider each other as just one family. My wife asked me to give the heirloom to Sarah on her birthday to continue the tradition. I was hesitant because I always intended it to give it to Claire who is Kate's only daughter as this is what she would have wanted and is the continuation of the tradition. My wife counters that this belongs to our family now and we should give it to our eldest daughter on her 18th birthday, and therefore this should be Sarah. I told her that while I consider Sarah to be my daughter but she's not Kate's daughter, this belongs to Kate and should go to Kate's daughter. My wife said Claire is HER daughter, not anyone else's and wife accused me of playing favorites and told me that if I truly consider Sarah to be my daughter then I'll do the right thing for her or that I haven't really accepted Sarah as a real daughter yet. I consulted my son (from Kate, 25 years old) and he told me that if I do this he's going to walk from the birthday party and that he bets he won't be the only one. He said if I do this I should be ready for severe consequences. He left in a very frustrated way. His argument in the end was that this isn't yours to give away. It was mom's and now belongs to Claire. My wife thinks my son is overreacting and it's only because due to his age and moving out he's never bonded with Sarah like Claire and I have, so he doesn't consider Sarah to be his real sister, otherwise he'd be happy for her. My wife thinks Claire will be happy about this since she considers Sarah to be her big sister and it will bring the girls even closer together because Sarah will happily share it with Claire and they'll both have it. So would I be the asshole if I did what my wife wants me to do and give the heirloom to Sarah?",

You can't tell who's right or who's wrong, there's always this ongoing tension between them but can be civil enough to sit together at one table. I recently got an invitation for christmas celebration from my parents. The invitation including me and Luke but Luke thought this was somewhat rude and a disrespectful because he believes he should get his own invitation and not have his name mentioned as an extention to mine. We talked and he said he wouldn't go unless they send him a proper invitation. I called mom and asked if she could do it. She thought it was ridiculous and said that she and dad did the same with my sister and her husband. I told her it was fine but Luke can be sensitive like that and so a simple invitation in a form of a text directly to him will fix it. She got defensive and said that Luke is being ridiculous. Dad claimed that Luke is trying to pull some power move to humiliate them but I thought this was a small issue. They still thought it was ridiculous so I told them I won't attend if they don't send him a separate invitation because he won't attend if he doesn't get it. This blew up and my sister started arguing saying Luke needs to get over himself and shamed me for trying to force our parents to send him an invitation by saying I won't come if they don't. We haven't talked after that and we're waiting as of now. edit! The invitation I recieved was in a text. Luke is saying that a simple text to him will finish the conflict but my parents still think it's ridiculous and that they won't invite him since they already have. **UPDATE! I just got off the phone with my sister. She told me our parents have just disinvited me (Luke was probably already disinvited since the argument occured) from the celebration. I feel horrible but I can't argue anymore, just like I can't argue about what everybody else in the comments is saying. I admit it! Luke is the problem. He just caused me to be disinvited from the event and is blaming ME for it.**",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I\u2019d like some input.  My wife and I struggle to make ends meet. We strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more.  Recently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we\u2019d already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she\u2019d figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she\u2019s gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong.  The next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said \u201coh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.\u201d Then she showed a few to me.  They were those \u201cEarn 0.07$ a gallon\u201d receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total.  I was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn\u2019t use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special.  I\u2019m so disgusted guys. I can\u2019t believe she did this. I don\u2019t even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I\u2019m an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive? Edit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I\u2019ve worked in for 15 years. I\u2019m on disability through my employer but it isn\u2019t even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don\u2019t know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can\u2019t take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I\u2019m going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys. ",

Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise. Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that!  For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out. Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was bonkers because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some explicit picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such demand and be pushy still. This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable. Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.",

        "selftext": "I (27m) have been living with my girlfriend (29f) for several months now. For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her. However we've run up against a conflict. She's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast. Meanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning. However my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her no but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her. She seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?",

        "selftext": "My sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been planned a party for him. To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david.  The school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a normal class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david.  Well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her.  I just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything by this. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend always dressed comfortably and practically until recently; she works at a professional job, and she would usually wear jeans, sneakers, T shirts or sweaters, etc. About a month ago, she had her friend shave both sides of her head, but leave hair on the top and back of her head. I wasn't a huge fan of it but she said she wanted it for a while, but she was too afraid of being embarrassed if it turned out badly. But now that everyone is working from home, nobody can go out, she took the chance and she loves it. Then she bleached her brown hair to blonde. Then in a week she dyed it florescent green. And she was buying a lot of new clothes, crop tops and tank tops, really loud patterned pants, platform sneakers that look like running shoes but have a sole that's like 3 inches tall? Just generally flashy and eccentric stuff. And whenever I ask, she says that this is more her style but she's just been more comfortable getting into it when there's less social pressure. She's stopped wearing bras and that's also awkward because I can tell she gets stares I asked what she's going to do when she has to go back to work, and she said she'd dress appropriately but obviously couldn't change her hair. But she didn't think that would be a problem, she'd been practically indespensable during the difficult time the company was having recently, and she couldn't see there being any trouble over hair. I've said I also don't love her new look, and she's always like I don't look that different, like it's still me but honestly she does look really different. We had a fight after I asked her a couple times to just wear normal things when we hang out together, and she got really upset with me over it, saying that she was just trying to have some fun and try something different and it was really rude of me to tell her how to dress AITA for being annoyed with my girlfriend's change in style?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account + obligatory mobile formatting apology. I (52M) am the father of 3 kids, 15F, 7F, and 7M. The last two are twins and are very close, having the tendency to copy each other. I love and adore them all equally. My son is not a very masculine kid, and is less interested in some of my hobbies because of this. He has always preferred whatever his mother and older sister did, like baking or dancing. I have no problem with this, I love him as he is, but to be honest, I\u2019m slightly disappointed that we haven\u2019t had the kind of amazing father-son bonding that I got to have with my Grandpa (my Dad died when I was pretty young) when I was a kid.   Since I\u2019m at home almost all the time now, I\u2019ve been seeing just *how* feminine his interests have gotten. Asking to help cook every meal, helping his older sister alter second-hand clothes, and playing pretend. He\u2019s even asked to have his sister paint his nails. I\u2019m not upset or bothered by it, but it isn\u2019t typical for young boys.  I\u2019ve been working out at home instead of at the gym because of our current circumstances, and when my son came in while I was lifting weights in the family room, he showed an interest in it. He was excited about the idea of having big muscles, and tried out some of the 5lb ones. Even though he mentioned being like She-Ra (from some new Netflix reboot, I think?), it was still progress in my eyes and it seemed like he was showing interest in masculine hobbies. I praised him and did the whole *\u201dwow, you\u2019re so strong!\u201d* thing in kid-talk to encourage him.  When his sisters walked in, the twin (7F) joined in. Like I said, they have the tendency to want to do what the other is doing so she expected the same kind of \u201cwow, so strong!\u201d stuff. When I wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic with her and focused on my son, my oldest got annoyed and asked why I was treating them differently. I explained to her that because he hadn\u2019t taken interest in these kinds of masculine hobbies before, I wanted to foster his own identity as a boy separate from his twin sister. She accused me of being misogynistic for this! She then said that I was TA for making his sister feel weaker and implying that I didn\u2019t approve of his feminine interests. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m TA, because there\u2019s no reason for my daughter to be inclined towards this kind of thing, but my son should be developing a more masculine personality as he gets older.  When she told my wife (41F), she also blew up at me, saying I was acting like a cartoon misogynist. Both of them are pissed. So, Reddit, AITA? |Edit:| Hey everyone. I was 100% TA. I appreciate that some people tried to empathize and say NTA or NAH to be charitable, but I\u2019m in the wrong here and I knew it deep down while I was writing the post. Re-reading it, I feel ridiculous for writing that all out. I want to say thank you, because these comments where the objective kick in the ass I really needed! I realize now that I was really out of line for saying that shit and making my daughters feel that way. I set up a stupid false dichotomy, and my daughter was very right, I was being a misogynist. No excuse for that. I apologized to both of them and my wife an hour after I posted. I also shared this post with my little brother, who, as I mentioned in a comment, was teased for being effeminate as a kid/teen, especially after he came out. I think some people took me mentioning that as blaming him, which wasn\u2019t my intention at all- none of my behavior is his or anybody else\u2019s fault.  We talked for a while and that (along with many of the comments you guys left!)  made me aware of how badly I\u2019m treating my son. My Grandpa, who raised my brother and I for most of our lives, was a \u201cmanly\u201d guy who I\u2019ve always idolized completely. Well, my brother made me aware that my Grandpa in particular made him feel shitty about his femininity and his sexual orientation. He would regularly say degrading, terrible things. I was oblivious to just how much that hurt him, and it seems that I\u2019ve picked up some of these same ideas. I\u2019ve been such a dick for so long, and now that I realize how absurd some of the ideas I\u2019ve held onto are, I know how much of a disservice I\u2019ve done to my boy. I shouldn\u2019t try to make him change just to protect him from bullies. In this situation, I\u2019m the bully as much as it hurts to think.  I\u2019m planning on talking with him about this issue and apologizing. If we can this week, I want to let him choose something that he likes that we can do together. I\u2019m not going to make the same mistakes my Grandpa did. At my brother\u2019s and some redditors\u2019 suggestions, I\u2019m considering trying out therapy or a support group. After a mistake (huge fuck up) like this, I think I ought to try to be the best dad (and big brother!) I can be and work to stop thinking that way, especially when I\u2019ve already done so much damage.  I\u2019m sorry about the extremely long edit, but thank you for your responses and helping me with this issue. I showed my wife some comments and she also thanks you all! |Edit 2|: This will probably be the final update, but wow! I\u2019m overwhelmed will all the responses, I wasn\u2019t expecting so many. Thank you to everyone, I\u2019m glad you guys were honest (but still encouraging!). I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply to you all. I got a lot of really kind and personal messages and I want you guys to know I\u2019ve taken it to heart. Some people asked what I\u2019m going to do with my daughters, since it seems like I focused more on my son in the edit. My oldest wants to try Krav Maga, so in the coming weeks we\u2019re hoping to find a place that\u2019ll accommodate both ages. Youngest daughter has wanted to learn how to roller skate too, so my 15 year old may have to teach us both! I was able to talk to my son for a while this morning and apologize for yesterday. Talking about gender roles and all the trauma surrounding my Grandpa may be something I\u2019ll talk to him more about as he gets older, but I got the message across that I support whatever he\u2019s interested in. I asked him about She-Ra (some commenters told me that it\u2019s fun for adults too) and we watched a few episodes together. You guys were right! My oldest and I both thought it was very cute. I asked him what he would want to do together, and he mentioned trying to alter something. I brought down a box of my old stuff from the attic and lo and behold- I found one of the 80s Hawaiian shirts my grandpa bought me (probably an effort to make me look like Tom Selleck). With some guidance from my oldest, we\u2019re going to try to make it fit my son with room for him to grow into it. I think it\u2019ll turn out nicely, and because it\u2019s \u201creally vintage\u201d my 15 year old loves it.  So everything is pretty good right now. I invited my brother over (lives a few hours away) for dinner so my son and I can make him something. I can\u2019t believe that I was feeling upset about him liking baking and everything, I\u2019m lucky that my boy wants to help everyone. So, I\u2019m definitely TA, but I\u2019m slowly becoming NTA! Thank you all. I showed my oldest some of my favorite comments and she thinks they\u2019re great and I should expect a \u201cclown of the year\u201d award for a father\u2019s day gift, haha!",

        "selftext": "Title sounds very bad and horribly racist, but let me clarify: So my brother (He's 25) has been dating an American-born girl to indian parents since last year (She's 23). Her parents do not like their relationship because he's White and probably prefer her to find an indian man. He has been trying to gain their approval but failing and from what he said, they continue to shrug him off and actively exclude him if she tries to bring him to her family events.  This has annoyed me because my brother is one of the nicest people I know. In the mean time, I proposed to my girlfriend and we're sending out invites to everyone. I came to the difficult decision that since his gf's family will not accept him, we will not accept her. I talked it over with my girlfriend and told her how strongly I feel about this and she agreed. I didn't want to spring this up on her, so I asked his gf if we could meet up and I sat down with her and explained that in good conscious, I could not invite her to our wedding if her family cannot accept my brother and I essentially boiled it down to if they don't want my brother, we don't want you. I told her she will be banned from all of our future family events until something changes with her parents in regards to my brother.  She got upset about it and this caused a huge divide in my family. My brother obviously is against it but I wanted to do it out of support for him. Other relatives agreed this was the right thing to do, but I've been seeking judgement from outside my family to gain a clearer perspective if I was being an asshole in making this decision? EDIT: I just want to clarify to all the posters that I am NOT doing this to punish her or her family. She still hangs around her family a lot and given that her family is disrespectful to my brother, I feel that makes her toxic and I do not want toxic people at my wedding. If she disowns her family then she can come",

My husband and I are more than happy to have them stay for few weeks til they get this resolved. However, Yesterday at 7pm, I was in the kitchen when my husband rushed in and said that he saw both my sister and her husband walk out of the bathroom. They'd most likely taken a shower together. My husband said that it irked him and I agreed that what they did was somewhat inappropriate. He asked me to speak to my sister on the matter and I did. She got defensive asking how this is affecting me or my husband in any way. I told her that it made my husband feel uncomfortable and would rather that they just take their showers seperately. She started ranting about being overwhelmed by their son's health problems and not having some alone time together as a married couple and found this activity as a bonding time to spend together. I apologized for how she felt but requested that she just do as asked. She got mad at me and said that I was being inconsiderate and she didn't understand my husband's hangup on what she and her husband do. We started arguing and she stormed off to the guests room where my nephew and BIL are. She's not speaking to me but my husband said I did the right thing by speaking to her and setting this boundary. AITA? Am I (and my husband) overreacted to this? Some infos: 1. My husband did not mention hearing anything, just that he saw them get out of the bathroom. And yes they were clothed. 2. It's the only bathroom in the house. 3. They spent apprximately 10+ in the shower according to my husband. EDIT* I'm gonna bring my husband to look at the responses and help answer some questions down here, okay? Just give me a few minutes. EDIT* I'm sorry I can't respond to every single comment but my husband says he's uncomfortable and doesn't want to expand on the situation.",

        "selftext": "My son (24M) and his girlfriend (24F) have only been together for 6 months, and she is apparently 4 months pregnant with his baby. They have actually been friends since high school, and so my husband and I have known her for a few years as well.  She is a lovely girl, but honestly she is not someone I had hoped would be the mother to my first grandchild. First of all, she is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years, a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely on her own. Our family is considerably better off, and my son is joining his father's business, meaning his salary will be quite high and will only continue to grow.  Since my son first told us she is pregnant, it can't escape my mind that he may not really he the father, and that she picked him out of potential others because he would be the best in terms of support.  My son is pushing us to help her with some of her pregnancy expenses, and I told him we would under the condition that she get a paternity test first. He completely blew up at that, accusing us of disliking her (untrue) and not wanting to he grandparents (also untrue). He says he loves her and trusts her and that he can't wait to meet his baby. I get that, but I think he's being idealistic. If he wants our support, we want a paternity test first. If the baby is truly his then we would be happy to welcome her into our family and we would be happy to help her out. AITA? Edit: there are 7k replies to this post, and over 200 private messages in my inbox that I can't reply to. It's a pretty even mix of YTA and NTA, so clearly the only thing everyone can agree with is that it's complicated. I've gotten messages to kill myself, I've gotten messages calling my son an idiot, and I have gotten messages from the MGTOW subreddit telling me that the girlfriend is clearly a lying sociopath. I have also gotten a lot of messages from men who found out their child wasn't theirs after several years, who wish they had found out sooner.  It's a lot to read, and a lot to think about. Many people have called out my attitude towards this girl and I'll be honest, it is making me think.",

        "selftext": "My (39M) wife (34F) and I live in at a suburban house with our daughter (10F, Emily). Our neighbour next door (48M, Walter) is a single father with two daughters (14F and 12F). We have been living here for a little more than two years. My wife really likes watching scary movies but I have never enjoy them. I get too scared and end up having a bad time so I prefer to avoid them. Her friends sometimes go with her to the more popular ones but she also likes older, indies and foreign horror movies. She has always had a hard time finding people that have this niche interest and that is why it was such a big deal when we met Walter and found out he also shares this tendency. They very quickly started to make plans to watch movies together. I was invited to be a part of this but refused. I prefer to just stay at home babysitting Emily and Walter's daughter while they are in their cinephile reunions. Sometimes they go to movie theaters but other times they just stay at Walter's place watching stuf at his home cinema. They usually have to go to another town in order to catch a specific function of some weird movie so it is normal for them to come back very late. They eventually started doing stuff outside of watching movies, like going out for dinner. Walter invited all of us, including the kids, to go with him to a restaurant that a friend of him owned but I said no because it was too expensive. I don't like that kind of places because I feel they are a waste of money and didn't think the kids would enjoy it either. I insisted on staying with the kids and let the two of them go be themselves. This has became a regular thing and it is in a way a good deal for me because Walter pays for my wife's dinner and she can't no longer complain about me not taking her to fancy restaurants. As both their movie and dinner nights had became so common, I have grown a little tired of the burden of constantly babysitting the girls. I talk to my wife and Walter about it and he explained that he usually does not like leaving his duaghters with babysitters. He says he is really comfortable knowing that they are being watched by an experienced father like me instead of some teenage girl. He nevertheless agreed that it was too much of a load for me and offered to start paying me a standard babysitter fee each time he goes out with my wife. I thought that was a fair approach to the issue but my wife was fully against it. She says I should not be paid for babysitting my own daughter nor the daughters of a close friend of our family like Walter. We have been arguing about this but she insists on this notion and it not open to change. She even gets mad every time I talk to her about this. Walter promised me that he will convince her but he does not seem to have been able to do so either. Am I the Asshole?",

        "selftext": "My GF and I got take out from an Indian restaurant we like and order from usually when our budget allows us. This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us  but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time.  This time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread  since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom. My friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the  other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole. Its been hours and she's ignoring me. AITA?",

        "selftext": " My M30 brother in law M20 Sean moved in with me and his sister after my father in law passed away few months ago. He is the private type and keeps to himself. He goes out and never say where he's going or how long he'll be out, eats at random times during the day, wears earpuds while me and the kids are sitting with him. See, all of these are uncool behaviors and a bad influence on my children. I've already talked to Sean about certain house rules I have and how he was violating them maybe because he didn't but now he knows and still nothing's changed. Last night, he came home late at around 10pm. I wasn't thrilled with that because he knew the rules but he said that he was an adult and I shouldn't be policing him but it's not about that, it's about the fact that he's repeatedly disrespected the homeowner and the rules...So I told him this: If he won't respect the rules which are: Being home at 8, not eating at random times, and not using his electronics just like my kids aren't allowed when the family is gathered to spend time together. He ranted about how he wasn't a child, my child and called me unreasonable to treat him this way just because he lives under my roof, I told him it's not hard to show respect really but my wife went off asking what was wrong with me to be giving Sean who's still grieving, ultimatums and treating him like a child. I explained to her that I'm just making sure the kids won't be influenced by her brother's reckless behavior and she laughed asking if I think Sean being on his phone was reckless but that is besides the point. She called me a control freak and told me to get off her brother's back and leave him alone. I replied that she's just saying this because he's her brother but she said I overstepped and should back off and stop trying to control her adult brother. I asked her if she was happy with him coming home late and she said she was sick of arguing then went upstairs. AITA here?",

        "selftext": "I know the title sounds bad but please hear me out. This is my first year in college. Everything is working out fine EXCEPT for my roommate. Ever since I moved here I just can\u2019t stand him. Why? I can write a whole story about why I despise this person but I don\u2019t wanna keep this long so I will just mention the key points. 1. He is really messy. His room is a total mess (not that I sleep there but I don\u2019t have TV in my room and sometimes have to go to his room for it. NOTE that we are paying equal rent so he isn\u2019t doing me a favor for it).2. He used to not even wash his plates until I told him I am not washing for him.3. He would leave a mess everywhere until I had to explain to him like he is a little kid as to why it\u2019s not good to have a dirty house.4. Bathroom smells horrible whenever he leaves it. He can\u2019t even clean the toilet after use. Luckily though, I would rarely see him because I would spend most of my times at either the library, gym or with friends or my girlfriend after classes. Now though, because of what is happening, I must stay in the house which is killing me. I now have to work out and study at home. I like to jump the rope as a cardio exercise for 10-15 minutes which can make some noise. 2 days ago, while I was exercising he told me to stop jumping rope and find something else because I make too much noise. I got so pissed off because I never complain when he does things that bother me but now he can\u2019t even handle some noise for 10 minutes? I told him I won\u2019t stop so he just went back to his room. Yesterday though when I wanted to work out again I couldn\u2019t find my rope. I asked him if he has seen it and told me he HID IT from me and will give it back to me when he finishes studying as he can\u2019t concentrate. I got so pissed off because again IT\u2019S JUST 10-15 MINUTES, maybe 20 with breaks in between. I never complain when he bothers me but he can\u2019t even handle this. Because of this, I hid his laptop when he was out today. While I was working out, he asked me if I had seen his laptop and I told him I will give it to him after I finish working out. He said he has an online exam tomorrow and that he needs it now to revise but I refused to give it. I\u2019m physically stronger than him so he can\u2019t do me anything either. He just went back to his room. Well. When I finished working out he asked for the laptop back. I went outside to get it but I couldn\u2019t find it anymore. I think someone must have stolen it. I told him I couldn\u2019t find it and he told me that if I don\u2019t give his laptop back today he will press charges on me but he has no proof so I doubt it will work. He is blaming me for stealing his laptop but I just hid it because he tried imposing restrictions on me. I didn\u2019t know it will get stolen. Today I even caught him stalking me on social media. I called him out on this. AITA for this? Or did he go too far?  Edit: Stop discussing about court and stuff like that. That is none of your business. Simply judge the post please. Edit2: You guys are funny if you think this post counts as a reliable proof.  Again, stop discussing about law. Edit3: I will no longer be answering or reading any comments related to laws.",

        "selftext": "Hello reddit, my daughter is 2 weeks old. I have barely held her since she was born. My wife constantly has her. When I do get to hold her, my wife just starts crying hysterically until I give her back. I asked her why and she said she was anxious that something would happen to our daughter and that's why she felt the need to hold her so close.  No matter how much I tried to reassure her, she just wouldn't let up. I practically begged her just to let me hold her so that my wife could shower, eat, and care for herself but nothing worked. I felt like I was losing precious bonding time with my daughter so I did what I thought I had to do. My wife fell asleep on the sofa with our child, I took her, went to the guest bedroom and locked the door.  My wife woke up shortly after, very upset of course that our daughter wasn't with her. She soon realized I was in the guest room and begged me to open the door. She was crying, kicking, and screaming. I didn't open it though, and spent a good couple hours with our daughter in there.  Apparently my wife had called her mom, because I got a call from my mil cussing me out, saying how I shouldn't be taking a newborn from her postpartum mother and other things like that. My wife has been furious with me and won't speak and I'm just so frustrated because I really just wanted to spend quality time with my child but maybe that wasn't the way to do it. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (40f) was a single mother to my daughter, Amy (15f). I came out 3 years ago and married my wife Jenna (42f) last year. She has a daughter, Nora (13f). We all live together as I have full custody of my daughter. It was kind of hard for her to adjust to having a second mom, but they got along well. The girls have their birthdays very close, only two days apart, so we decided to have a joint birthday party for both of them, since Nora had a hard time making new friends (they moved in with us and she's very shy). Most of my family lives out of the country, so the gifts were sent a week early. It was a huge bag, with at least 20 gifts. The party was nice and we opened the bag at night once everyone left. Jenna handed out the presents as she took them out. After 12 gifts in a row just for Amy, I checked the bag and froze to see that there was only one gift for Nora, from my parents. She pretended it wasn't a big deal, but as she opened the present I saw her eyes drop. It was a $15 tumbler from Walmart. Not to sound ungrateful, but Amy's gifts were much more expensive (lots of gift cards over $100, a new phone, limited-edition Funkos, designer clothes and lots of cards wishing her a happy birthday). Needless to say, I blew up the family chat, calling out my parents, siblings, and extended family who sent gifts for not considering Nora and my parents for the cheap gift. No one took me seriously since: *It's not our duty to give gifts to someone else's kid* and *Amy deserved them, since I didn't even throw her her own birthday party,* emphasizing that Jenna and Nora are my problem, not theirs. Nora was clearly hurt, since it's not the first time my family has left her out. At night, I asked Amy to share some of the gifts with her stepsister. Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, they usually get along. After asking why, Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes. Amy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things. AITA? Clarification: Jenna and I bought gifts for the girls (their own tablets), as well as their friends. Nora also received gifts from her extended family, but they sent for Amy as well.",

        "selftext": "I (20M) live in a flat with 5 others at university. There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit. So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex). I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening. I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk. So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does.  She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''.  The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat.  So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole. I then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA? **To those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's NOT true. Aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.** **To the people telling me that I should have spoken nicely to her, I SAID IN THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS I ALREADY DID THIS. Me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. What she did was say ''Okay'' and then continue to do the same shit. I'm writing this as a clarification for those comments.**",

He was suppose to go Wednesday , my wife\u2019s mother and father got in a car accident. They live in another state so we had to drive about 4 hours. My wife was a wreck and wasn\u2019t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily.  We have two other kids 11 and 7. We can\u2019t leave them at home alone and we couldn\u2019t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn\u2019t do it. So that left our 18 year old. He was pissed to put it mildly but did it. I told him we would make it up to him, and if he could ask if his friend could move it back a week. They couldn\u2019t sadly.  We were gone for two days, he pulled though. My wife stayed and I headed back, I payed him for watching the kids and went to talk to him about getting him on the trip. It was suppose to be two weeks and they should just be a state over. He blows up about ruining his trip and there is no point going even though it should still 12 days of the trip. He called up a jerk and lock himself in his room.  I need another opinion since this was emergency and he doesn\u2019t seem to care his grandparents almost passed.  Edit: Well he called his mom, let\u2019s say it didn\u2019t end well,  he did say basically said the same thing he said to me, wife had a breakdown on the phone with him, she sent him the injuries and pictures of grandpa/grandma. He finally came out of his room and told me he isn\u2019t going to go on the trip and the plan tickets aren\u2019t needed.  Talked to my wife, never heard her that mad. Son confirmed what happened, he started yelling at her the moment the call started and she lost her shit when he called her selfish. On good news grandpa has some feeling back in his legs which was a huge concern  For people saying we didn\u2019t have emergency plan we do, first my closest friend- vacation, main babysitter- not available, backup babysitter- not available, last resort grandparents- hospital.  We tried to find someone that why we even asked our neighbor which I have a good relationship with. This will be my last update, had a conversation with my son about everything. Mom and him will have a conversation when she is calms down. His friends are not a state over, they are about two down at this point and going to Mexico. They are probably will get to the boarder tonight, they were suppose to be going to California . He had his passport and everything ready. This is a fucking mess. I haven\u2019t informed my wife yet and will wait until she is calmer. I\u2019ll leave off with I hope none of you ever have to deal with a situation like this and please remember your parents are human",

Their dad and I split up 6 years ago and I'm now (fixed it it was not but I meant now)married to my husband Kevin Problem is...Kevin thinks that my girls are not discipline simply because they don't follow everything he tells them because they don't see him as their father...We've already talked about that. Especially the part where he expects them to dress how he wants them to, and behave how he wants them too. He even called them weirdos but that's just how teenagers are and it's not a new thing. Anyways. I told him he needed to loosen up a little and lessen his expectations of them but I get it's hard to do given he was brought up in a conservative household with hard-core Christian family. Last week. He started a fight after seeing one of the girls' hairstyle and said that she was looking trashy. Because of the we had to cancel our trip to the mall because he refused to drive us. A couple of days ago. We wanted to go out for dinner. I was intending on getting off work at 6 but had some stuff to get done. My husband and I agreed that he'd take the girls and go to the restaurant and wait for me there. He called me before they got out of the house to complain about what the girls were wearing. The girls sent me pics and I thought nothing was wrong with their outfits and told him to drop it and just go. He said fine then muttered something about me enabling thrm then hung up. While I was still at work I got a call from one of the girls telling me their stepdad had them stand and wait outside the restaurant because he didnt want to be seen with them dressing like that. I was stunned I rushed to the restaurant and found them near the car. They explained he told them to wait in the car til he tell them to come in (basically wait for me) they started crying I had them get in my car then went inside the restaurant and found him on his phone. I went off on him and told him he should be ashamed of himself for treating my daughter's like if there was something to be ashamed of. He tried backpaddling saying it wasn't like that but I interrupted him then walked out after cancelling dinner. We went home and he came back hours later trying to argue that I can't blame him for disapproving of what the girls recklessness and that he tried communicating but I shut him down and treated him as less of a parent when he's just wanting what's best for them. He doesn't speak to me or the girls anymore.",

        "selftext": "I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter.  My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes.  My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'.  Now, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired. So I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head.  I am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

She's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so I ate the rest of an almost full packet. She has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so I assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. Fuck, it was already gone, so I've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that I'm a dead man when she gets back.  She once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm not taking chances. Toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that I bought I new one. For now I'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. I'm in the UK btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in Switzerland. AITA? Also, she religiously reads this sub, so if she comes across this - G, I love you and I hope you forgive me like you did with the pasta.

        "selftext": "My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal. Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question. We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it. Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids. It's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",

        "selftext": "My daughter (28) has gotten into DPS and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. She has been fostering this 8MO for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they sort out their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. Although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. My daughter hopes to keep Foster Child.  I am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet.  She went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process?  AITA? Edit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still. Final edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood.  I feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize.  Accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react.  My daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait. Thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong. Another edit: I accept judgment as I said about my actions... but I stand by my matching flannel idea. You should try a cheesy matching shirt photo, they're goofy memories to look back on.",

She's a really pretty woman, but she does have a slight flaw to her physical appearance; she has a bad case of TMJ which makes it so that when she gives a big smile one side of her mouth curls up into a huge grin while the other side basically stays still. Every selfie we've taken together has her looking like this. While I absolutely accept that this is just a condition she has I wish she would do what she can to make it less noticeable. We've recently started talking about becoming engaged. Both of our sets of parents are ecstatic since they both apparently thought that grandkids weren't happening from either of us. But when the subject of engagement photos came up I told her that she should not smile quite so broadly so as to let her true, natural beauty shine through. She got really, really angry at this and said that the curled up lip on one side *is* her natural beauty, since it's her. She said that she isn't even sure if marrying me is a good idea. I'm the youngest of four kids in my family and the only boy. My father (71m) when he heard about his told me that it was no wonder that none of my relationships have worked out through all these years and that I need to apologize to her and beg her forgiveness. My mother (67f) said that I should have been nicer but that she understands. I know all of this sounds bad but I just really want her to be at her best. That's not for my sake, but for her's.",

I had a collapsed lung and had a chest tube put in, a broken leg and arm and torn ligaments in my knee. I've been in the hospital since Monday.

Yesterday she only stayed until about 1 pm to prepare the house for the hurricane and didn't come at all today because the weather wasn't great and she said she didn't want to leave the kids.  I told her I was upset that I basically went through everything alone. That I would've done anything to be with her. She told me she's been there as much as possible and it's not fair to dump all the kids on her daughter especially since I'll need a lot of help when I get home and her daughter will need to help with the kids when she works. I told her marriage means through thick and thin and I feel abandoned. Now I'm getting one word answers from her. AITA for feeling like an afterthought?",

She\u2019s very demanding as well.  My SIL\u2019s family members are very disrespectful and rude. They don\u2019t clean up after themselves, expect everyone to act like maids or servants around them and they think very highly of themselves. They can never be wrong and think they can do no wrong.  Because of this my SIL\u2019s family don\u2019t really punish their kids. Like they have no consequences. They aren\u2019t even like the gentle parenting type either.  My SIL\u2019s sister has a son and he\u2019s extremely chaotic. He throws tantrums if he doesn\u2019t get something and he has to be center of attention 24/7. When they\u2019re are birthdays he needs a gift or opens the gifts and needs to blow out candles. It\u2019s frustrating which is why I\u2019m not usually around at family gatherings and other stuff.  I was my SIL since her friend cancelled on her and I was helping make invitations. I saw one of the names were SIL\u2019s nephew. I asked if she wanted him to go and she said yeah. She then asked why. So I told her why.  I talked about his tantrums and how he\u2019ll probably throw a fit during the reception and other stuff. She got mad and said that she didn\u2019t know what i was talking about. She told my family and her sister which caused her sister to write me a message saying how I was wrong and other stuff like that.  Well day of the wedding comes. Everyone comes in happy except Nephew. He\u2019s crying and is about to throw a fit. When my SIL came out he literally started screaming. The poor Pastor had to stop and wait for the parents to leave.  During the after party he was back and again crying. When they were cutting the cake he screamed extremely loud he pushed my SIL who was holding a glass of wine and spilled on her. She started crying. She turned around to leave and I looked at her and said \u201cI told you so\u201d she started crying even more now.   When i got home my mom called me extremely immature and wants me to apologize. So, aita? Edit: When i went on facebook I saw a long post from SIL\u2019s sister. Basically saying that SIL knew how her nephew (9) was, and how if she didn\u2019t want him to throw a tantrum she should\u2019ve never invited them. She also called SIL selfish saying she should\u2019ve offered nephew to cut the cake with her. SIL\u2019s family also agreed and called SIL selfish. So i went over to SIL\u2019s house with a bottle wine. She told me i was right and how she should\u2019ve never invited them. I still apologized though because I did kick while she was down. I\u2019ve offered to pay to get her wedding dress cleaned but she said that it was fine.",

To me, this is very important (I had hopes for a boy) unfortunately, the day of the dr appointment I had to attend my friend's birthday that I remembered last minute. I asked my wife if we could cancel the appointment and go another day but she looked shocked that I even considered canceling the appointment and going to my friend's birthday, I said I had no choice. She said canceling the dr appointment was off the table because these appointments are restricted to specific time and date and we can't miss it so she'll go alone. I told her no because that'd be selfish of her and besides this will ruin the news of finding out if the baby is a boy or a girl. She cut the discussion and told me to go to the birthday party. I did then later found out she didn't cancel the dr appointment and went with her mom. I came home seething and blew up at her. I started arguing with her about going behind my back and doing this without me. She said it wasn't her fault I prioritized a party over my child. I told her I didn't prioritize anything; she literally could've canceled and we would've went another day but clearly, she was trying to steer the fight to a direction where I look like the neglectful and irresponsible one. We fought some then she said I'm probably angry with her because it's a girl but I responded that she was wrong. She went outside the room claiming I was stressing her out. now acts like I owe her an apology on top of everything else but I feel upset and like I was decieved by her. AITA? INFO: first off ??? Jesus, I swear I came here thinking I was somewhat justified in my frustration but I was wrong it seems. Although I just wanna point out that I did not just go to the party without telling my wife and having a discussion with her first. Also the friend lives 2 hours away so I had to leave at 2 and the appoitment was at 4. I did not know she went and I would've appreciated it if she at least was upfront with me about what she did. She could've said she was going anyway but instead told me to go to the party and had me thinking she was going to cancel and reschedule. EDIT For those who are speculating on the type of parent I am/will be really don't know enough to make those assumptions so I'd appreciate it if you'd just focus on the conflict I just presented.",

She resisted at first, but after some urging from me she gave in. She said I absolutely could not excuse their behavior if they made a rude comment about her though. We got there and it was fine for a while. Then my mom and sister broke out their matching ugly sweaters, that had my girlfriends face all over it. They both laughed, saying my mom made them (screen printed) and it was just a joke. My dad thought it was hilarious, I even chuckled a little because she\u2019s really beautiful, so it was ironic they put her on the \u201cugly\u201d sweater. My girlfriend looked at me, and when I said they were just being ironic, she shook her head, got up and left. Didn\u2019t say anything to anyone, just took her car and left.  I called her several times, and she didn\u2019t answer. The only text I received was \u201cYou need to find your own way home.\u201d That pissed me off, and I called her a couple more times. The whole time, my mom is upset because it was just a joke and she didn\u2019t realize my girlfriend was going to overreact like that. I told her that a warning would have been nice, but my sister agreed it was just a joke and my girlfriend was being a baby about it.  I had another fight with my girlfriend when I finally got home and she said I was an asshole for putting her in that situation and I said I didn\u2019t realize they were going to do that and they were being ironic because she was beautiful. She said I let them treat her badly and was trying to make it her fault when it was my family who was acting badly. I said it was just a joke and that she was overreacting. She asked how it was supposed to be a joke. I said that was just their sense of humor. I said I was sorry she was offended by the joke, but she ruined the whole day with her reaction. She said that no, them realizing she wasn\u2019t going to take their bullshit anymore ruined the day.  We aren\u2019t speaking currently, but when a cousin called to wish me a merry Christmas and asked how the day went I mentioned what happened and he straight up called me an asshole for doing that to her. I don\u2019t really think I\u2019ve done anything though, I didn\u2019t know they were going to do that, and really it was just a joke and I think she\u2019s overreacting, am I really TA here?",

        "selftext": "I (17m) have two sisters, Alice (29) and Miranda (33). I am much closer to Alice than I am to Miranda. Miranda is also not on good terms with our parents. Alice has four kids and is currently expecting child number five, while Miranda can\u2019t have children which her ex divorced her for. Miranda is very successful in life, she has a nice apartment, works a good job and earns a decent amount of money. Alice, on the other hand, is struggling financially. She had her first kid right out of high school and got pregnant with her second child soon after, so she decided to become a SAHM to her children while her boyfriend provides for them. Me and my parents try to help them out as much as possible, be it childcare or money, whatever she needs. I love my nieces and nephews. I take them to the park and play with the older ones, I really enjoy it. Miranda doesn\u2019t help out with them, she says it\u2019s because she\u2019s too busy. Well, she works long hours, but she doesn\u2019t have kids, so I don\u2019t know what she does on weekends. She also doesn\u2019t help out financially, which I find unfair, since she makes so much money and all she does is spend it on herself, although she does give us very nice gifts for Christmas and birthdays. My parents nag her about it, saying she should give some of her money to Alice monthly, and I agree with that. So, here comes the part where I may have been an asshole. I was at Miranda\u2019s place last week, as she baked muffins and invited me over to eat some and catch up. We got on the topic of Christmas presents and I told her some of the stuff I wanted. She nodded and said she would give our parents a coupon for a much needed vacation and Alice some clothes she had mentioned and also some new boots and jackets for her kids. I was a little stunned she didn\u2019t have more for Alice, so I asked, \u201cWhy do you only get Alice the bare minimum? You can afford to help out more and you refuse to out of spite.\u201d Miranda looked at me and laughed. She said it wasn\u2019t her business to feed six people, that Alice was old enough to make her choices and live with the consequences. She knew what she was getting herself into and that she wouldn\u2019t pay Alice\u2019s way through life just because she kept having children she couldn\u2019t afford. I was stunned at how cold she reacted. I asked her how she could live her life being so selfish and uncaring, and she got angry and told me, \u201cListen, kid, there are some thing you are way too young for to be discussing with me, and this is one of those. Drop the subject or get out.\u201d I got really frustrated with her and said something I probably shouldn\u2019t have. I told her, \u201cNo wonder your husband divorced you, even if you could have children, you would be a terrible mother.\u201d Miranda got very quiet and told me to leave and never come back. She has now blocked me on everything, and though I don\u2019t agree with her not helping out, I\u2019m starting to feel guilty for what I said. So, AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (33) get a call from the ER on Friday saying that my wife (32) drove herself there because of searing pelvic pain.  I\u2019m on a business trip until Saturday but I drive back in time to be there Saturday morning before she woke up.  A while after she wakes up, the doctor comes in. My wife says to stay with her so I say ok. He takes a deep breath and said that from the transvaginal ultrasound and CT scan results, she has ovarian cancer. My wife starts sobbing but at first I stay still because I don\u2019t even know what to make of it.  My wife asks what that means for her and he says that she\u2019ll likely at least need a full hysterectomy, and they\u2019d have to remove the Fallopian tubes as well as the ovaries.  That news jolted me from my chair. Because the doctor was effectively telling me that she wouldn\u2019t be able to have kids after this, and after years of work, I thought we\u2019d finally have a family. I\u2019m overwhelmed with emotions of anger, not just anger at the disease, but pent up anger form the fact that I had begged her to have kids since we were 26, but she refused for her career. And now instead of becoming a real family, I didn\u2019t even know if she would remain the woman I married, whether the last picture of us together would be last time I\u2019d remember her looking beautiful, young, and carefree. Because the wife I as in front of me was already a different person.  My wife started to grab my hand and say \u201c We\u2019ll fight this and we\u2019ll adopt.\u201d  But I shook my head and turned to walk out the door. I still had my suitcase in the car so I drove to a hotel because I didn\u2019t know if my wife was going to end up being discharged or what.  At the hotel I was at least able to get out of reactive mode, but I was still so disappointed  that our dream of a family was over.  I finally was able to get a grasp on all my emotions and feel more like my normal self in that I knew exactly what I felt about every aspect and how I would react to it from here on out.  I get a call from my MIL saying that if I was at a hotel or \u201c wherever else\u201d I should just stay there.  AITA for walking out? I admit it was done on impulse but this diagnosis just sliced my life and my wife\u2019s life wide open.  I wasn\u2019t going to expel the cancer if I stayed that night but I did at least make myself aware of my situation. And I feel I have a right to be angry that my hope of biological kids, the only kind I ever wanted, is rapidly fading away.",

        "selftext": "Ok so this is kind of a weird situation. My wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. Like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. You don't ever catch her doing anything impolite, whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter.  She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about needing privacy to pee, I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done.  Well she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, See! I knew you shit too! She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again. Every once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here! She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. But I kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said I was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. So AITA? I'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her. Edit: Welp, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I guess the general consensus is that I am TA, so I guess I'll try to tone it down for now until she has more time to calm down over it.",

        "selftext": "I (54M) have two children (23F and 21M) with my wife (52F). When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them. My wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money. My daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school. My son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work. My daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA? UPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to [other grandkid who is 5] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter. Thanks for asking tho. UPDATE 2: My wife and I are discussing our daughter's response and our next actions to resolve this situation. For context, my wife has always had a strained relationship with my daughter and did not approve of many of her life choices. She believes we should take our daughter's words at face value and assume she no longer wants the money. From some of the responses here, I fear that my daughter's response was out of resentment and I suggested taking out as much money as her brother was given so at least they received the same amount. She could use it responsibly towards rent, groceries, transportation, etc. or in some other way to further her career, so it would still be for educational purposes in a sense. My wife is standing firm in her opinion, and we will continue talking it through tomorrow.  Many have asked about where my parents stand on this. At this point, they are not mentally aware enough to really participate in the discussion. They did know about our grad school stipulation and thought it was fine. They also knew that we took out some money for our son once we were certain he was not pursuing an advanced degree, and were fine with that as well. They said it was our decision as parents what to do with our daughter's fund, and they would support whatever we decided for her. It wouldn't be useful to ask them what to do with it now, but I have always said that whatever is unused will go back to their care. I have tried to call my daughter with no luck, which is why I sent the text. Despite what many have said here, I hope this does not end our relationship. ",

        "selftext": "I(24F) have been dating Jay(28M) for four months. He is handsome, smart, funny, well-educated, has an awesome job, and is a sweetheart. Sunday he had a whole day planned for us. We were going to walk a nature trail and then go back to his place for dinner he was making. I was so excited because it was going to be the first time I'd be at his house. Since we were hiking he said I could bring my dog Shelby with us. He made us a roast and some vegetables for dinner. I finished my plate before Jay did and took it to the kitchen. There was still about half the roast left and it was close to Shelby's dinner time so I took half of the half of roast and some still raw vegetables from the fridge to put on a plate for Shelby. I was carrying the plate to the back door with Shelby to feed her outside and Jay asked me what I was doing. I told him feeding Shelby. Jay said something like Well that's not dog food. Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw diet. I opened the door to put the plate down for Shelby and Jay got up, took the plate away from her, went to the kitchen and came back with it wrapped up in tinfoil and told me to leave. His excuse was that he made dinner for me and him, not me, him, and my dog and that I should've asked before I helped myself since he would've used his leftovers. I did leave but not before telling him that he made that meal for us so I could do with some of it as I pleased and he knew damn well how I feed Shelby. I tried talking to my friend about it later that night but she said Jay was right to be upset but this friend has never really approved of how I treat my own dog so I feel like she was probably a bit biased and the wrong person to ask. AITA for just feeding my dog like I normally would? Clarification: She does NOT get restaurant food daily, I eat out maybe 4 times a month. If what I eat is dog safe or the restaurant makes food for dogs on request, THEN I bring some home for her. Shelby's daily meals are a bit of brown rice, raw vegetables, and ground chicken hearts and beef livers. The hearts and livers are boiled just enough to kill bacteria and that is all with the approval of Shelby's vet. I asked Jay how he prepared the roast so I could know if it was safe to give her. That's also why I got her fresh, unused vegetables from the fridge. Update: I accept that Im the AH for what I said and did to Jay. Some of these responses were harsh but I see now how and why I was entitled. Thanks to people that responded to the actual issue. Others going on about her diet, thanks for the concern? but I came here to ask about Jay. Not get into a debate about dog foods. Shelby's been on her diet for 6 years and is a healthy and active puppo, that's all I and my vet need to know. As for Jay, I apologized to him and he did accept my apology but he broke it off. He said it was the last straw for him over me doing things without asking first. He has talked to me about taking things off his plate or his drink without asking before. I've tried to do better but keep slipping up. I didn't realize I was that bad about it so I'm going to work on myself for the next guy. For people that said not going to his place for 4 months was a red flag, that was my decision that he respected. I don't want to go to someone's house or them know where I live the first few months of dating and getting to know each other.",

Now the situation, My 27th birthday was few days ago. we celebrated at a small diner with my guy friends and my wife. now my guy friends are brutally honest and make jokes and tease all the time, my wife knows how they are so no surprises there. Anyways, My wife took a miute to use the toilet to get her makeup fixed as me and the boys were chatting. when she got back she asked me how she looked and before I could answer, My friend Austin responded by jokingly saying Damn, you look like you just got out of the cancer ward with that heavy makeup on your face!. the rest of the guys started laughing and I just stared at my wife. she got very upset and started arguing with Austin about how awful he was. others joined in and there was so much comotion. I felt upset that they were fighting during my birthday celebration. I asked my wife to calm down and take a seat but she asked if I was okay with my friends making fun of her. Austin said come on It was a joke! I threw my habds up and said that I admit that my wife overreacted because really it was a joke, She lashed out on me and took an uber home. The party was cut short and when I got home we began arguing. I told her she overreacted and that she shouldn't take everything seriously knowing how great she always looks but she turned it into an argument about how I let my friends insult her, and how I should've defended her and her integrity after I basically forced thise guys upon her when she was the ine who arranged for this enitre celebration. she kept crying about getting humiliated and me dismissing her feelings and saying she overreacted.",

My roommate asked if we had cats prior to moving in because she said her cat \u201cdoesn\u2019t like other cats.\u201d We did not have any pets at the time so it worked out. We did tell her that we might want one someday to which she said we would have to revisit the issue if it came up. Well, my girlfriend and I have gotten to a place where we really want a pet of our own. We saw a kitten at the shelter and just fell in love with him. We got the okay from our landlord and brought him home last week! His name is Banana Pudding! :) Our roommate is furious with us. She told us that we were aware that her cat doesn\u2019t like other cats. I told her honestly that it\u2019s unfair for us to have to tiptoe around her cat and that we were allowed to have our own pets as long as the landlord is okay with it (which he is). She couldn\u2019t expect us to never get a pet or to cater to her cat\u2019s needs 24/7. The conversation ended there.  Unfortunately things have escalated because her cat hisses and swats at Banana Pudding just for existing. She is honestly pretty aggressive which is a big issue imo. Our kitten is very friendly and sweet and causes no problems. We asked our roommate that she keep her cat in her bedroom since she\u2019s elderly and aggressive. She refused and hasn\u2019t been speaking to us. She says we are huge AHs and even got some mutual friends to take her side. I personally think that if her cat is so aggressive and uncomfortable, it\u2019s her responsibility to live alone. It\u2019s gotten so bad that my girlfriend is crying and considering taking the kitten back to the shelter. So here I am to get an outside perspective because idk what to think now. AITA? EDIT: So I am definitely the AH. The comments have really helped me to understand that my roommate\u2019s cat is just acting\u2026 well, like a cat! I am willing to admit I was ignorant and impulsive. I have never had a pet before and should have done more research before jumping into pet ownership. I plan to sincerely apologize to my roommate. She is willing to talk once she gets home from work. I am going to see if she\u2019s willing to try a proper introduction for both kitties and Banana Pudding will be staying in our room for the duration while her kitty will be able to roam. I am hopeful that things will work out and I want to thank everyone for being blunt and educating me. I was impulsive and inconsiderate, but my roommate is a great person and I think she will forgive us and be willing to try to make it work. EDIT #2: Roommate and I have talked. I apologized to her for being selfish, ignorant, and for putting her cat in an uncomfortable situation. She forgave me and said she\u2019d be happy to help do a proper introduction between the kitties. She said that if we do things slowly and carefully, her cat might be able to accept Banana Pudding. For now, our kitten will be staying in our room for the introduction process. She also taught me a little bit about cat body language and guys\u2026 her cat came and sat in my lap! She even purred! My roommate is a very kind and forgiving person and I\u2019m very thankful that she chose to forgive me after I was such a huge AH to her. She played with Banana Pudding and gave me some cat food recommendations. I think things are gonna work out. Thanks everyone for your advice and criticism!",

        "selftext": "Okay hear me out. So today I took my baby over to my parents\u2019 house for dinner, without my wife. We have a five month old, she\u2019s home with the kid all day while I\u2019m at work and needed a break\u2014so I went with the baby. Works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and I bring her home a doggie bag with dinner. On the way home, around 10pm, I made a left in a no left. It saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. It\u2019s a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger. Of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and I get pulled over. Here in Ontario, \u2018disobey a sign\u2019 is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how I know\u2026). Baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. So just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, I just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. Baby woke up and starting screaming. When I rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way. Baby was perfectly fine. I gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. We\u2019re home now and she\u2019s asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. I felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so I moved $100 (what I would have paid for the ticket) into the kid\u2019s RESP (university fund). \u2018My wife was absolutely furious when she found out\u2019 is what I might say if I was a complete idiot and had told her.

Due to limited space, no children were invited to the wedding except the bride's young nieces and nephews.  My baby was 10 months old at the time and I wasn't comfortable leaving him alone in an unfamiliar place with a stranger, which was a babysitter that my other cousins hired for their own kids. So I decided to bring him to the wedding. I wrote on the RSVP that I was bringing him but he would be sitting on my lap and I would bring my own food for him. My cousin didn't say anything so I assumed that he was OK with it. My baby cried at the ceremony but I quickly took him out of the room. At the reception I had him with me the whole time in a body carrier. He didn't make much of a fuss and I thought everything was OK.  After the wedding my aunt (groom's mom) confronted me and told me that I was rude for bringing my baby without permission. I explained that I wrote on the RSVP what I was planning to do but my cousin didn't object. She said that my cousin and his bride had a problem with it but the bride didn't want to start any drama because she doesn't know me well.  My other cousin's baby was 7 months old at the time and my aunt said that he had no problem leaving his baby with the certified babysitter and I should of done the same. And some of my cousins were upset because they thought that the groom gave me special treatment by letting me bring my baby and making them leave their kids with a babysitter. I didn't mean to start any drama. AITA?",

        "selftext": "I (24 F) got engaged to Derrick (30 M) one month ago. Prior to that, we had known each other for six months. I know that\u2019s not a long time, but when you know, you know. We are madly in love and ready to commit ourselves to each other fully.  My sister (26 F) has a problem with that though. She was supportive of my relationship with Derrick before we got engaged. When I sent her a text telling her we were engaged, she responded by saying \u201ccongratulations.\u201d But then when I saw her the week after that, she got all serious and said I should strongly consider the marriage.  She told me I was young and could meet people I loved more. That was offensive to me because I love Derrick more than anything, and she\u2019s basically saying my love isn\u2019t that important. She also told me that Derrick and I could date for longer before we got married. But we are already fully committed to each other, so we might as well get married and be recognized as soul mates in the eyes of the law.  Anyway, the conversation was so hurtful to me. I eventually asked her, very directly, \u201cdo you support me marrying Derrick?\u201d She said no. So I stood up, told her she shouldn\u2019t be at the wedding if she didn\u2019t want us to get married, and left. I haven\u2019t talked to her since, although she has texted me multiple times asking to talk.  Derrick and I were working on the wedding guest list yesterday, and we both agreed my sister should not come if she doesn\u2019t support us. So we are planning not to invite her. I mentioned this to my friend yesterday, and she pointed out that it may be a little rude of me not to invite her. So, AITA for not inviting my unsupportive sister to my wedding?",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because some of this made local news and I don't want it connecting back to me. I work in a place where we are not allowed to have personal electronics on us at all. No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before. Recently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk.  My wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work. I won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me. When I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely *insane*.

She\u2019s always been artistic and has been tattooing herself and friends for years. My parents are more conservative and traditional so when they planned a trip to visit us I told her to just wear longer clothes to cover them up. She refused and on the day they visited she wore a crop top with shorts which showed off most of her tattoos. I warned her again before they came in about it but she just shrugged me off. I was shocked when my parents came in and just started complimenting her on the tattoos especially my mom. My mom spent ages to her talking about tattoos so me and my dad went out to the backyard. When we came back in my mom rushed up to my father to show off the tattoo my girlfriend gave her it was four small flowers running up her arm she said it represented our family.  My dad loved it and my mom was busy telling everyone on Facebook about it, my girlfriend then came downstairs and I asked her why would she put that on my mom without asking me she laughed in my face and said my mom was a grown woman. My parents then took my girlfriends side so I just stormed off upstairs. I could hear them for hours downstairs until my parents left.

They could hardly wait for Christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents early. So we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them. It was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when I told them they could open it on Christmas eve. They tore into it like a couple savages. I'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get at the goods.  As the final paper was ripped off the present, the oldest was going like it's a..it's a and the final paper came off, brick. I thought it was hilarious. The looks on their faces was priceless. Unfortunatly they were somewhat upset, tears were shed etc. So we let them open one more present to calm them down. Am I the asshole for wrapping a brick as a present?",

        "selftext": "My husband thinks I'm in the right, but my niece helped me make this post on here to see what other people think. I (52f) have three sons ages ranging from 13 to 20. My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap. It is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household. Yesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated. I found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything. My son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?  Edit: Thanks for all the comments. I have spoken to my son about the issue, and you all made me realize that it was deeper than just the water. I showed him this post and explained that it's not her, it's me. I think she reacted that way when I initially told her off for filling up the bottle because--and my son helped me realize this, too--I was never really nice to her to begin with, in the course of their three year relationship (in my defense, she only started hanging around our house a lot about six months ago because she got a license).  We called her on the phone this morning and I apologized for my reaction to the bottle. I explained I didn't mean to make her feel bad about the water--it really wasn't that big of a deal, and I feel silly for making it a big deal. She apologized for having an attitude and explained how she can feel a little defensive around me sometimes. I told her and my son that I will work on my attitude. My husband still thinks she was being disrespectful but I explained that I'm the reason she felt the need to act that way in the first place. It's not my choice who my son decided to date and I need to respect his choice. I think she is a sweet girl, and I feel horrible for the way I have been treating her. Again, thank you to everyone for making me realize my mistake. PS: I have looked into purchasing a Brita pitcher to see if that is more cost effective. My son's girlfriend now brings water from home--although I didn't tell her to do that.",

All of our children have been planned, but it\u2019s always been my husband pushing to have another. If he\u2019d have let me I would\u2019ve stopped after our oldest. I never really wanted to be a mom, and don\u2019t feel as though I connect with them very well.  A few nights ago I was putting my eldest daughter to sleep when she started asking me loads of questions. She\u2019s a really curious little girl. I had a traumatic birth with her and post natal depression so always struggled with bonding, and still do struggle connecting with her. She told me she wants lots of babies when she\u2019s older and then asked me how many I wanted when I was her age. I told her I didn\u2019t want any and that I didn\u2019t even want any when I had her. I know she\u2019s only 5 but she massively misinterpreted it and got upset. I comforted her and put her back to sleep.  In the morning she must\u2019ve told her father what had happened when he was making her breakfast as I woke up to my husband absolutely furious with me for traumatising our daughter and damaging her self esteem. I told him she\u2019d be fine but he kept shouting at me telling me I was an awful mother. I replied that it\u2019s hard being a good mother to kids you regret having. He asked if I was being serious and I said that I was being impulsive when I said that but that I didn\u2019t want them and he knew that. He left the room absolutely furious with me and took the kids to his parents house. AITA? UPDATE - Thankyou to all of you who messaged me with your support, and thankyou to those who told me to die, I considered it. My husband and kids have returned home and taking your advice, have told her that I may not have wanted kids but I want her and I love her. She\u2019s now happy in her room playing with her Barbies.

        "selftext": "My wife (34) and I (33) are having our second child. We have a daughter (5).  She\u2019s been grouchy her whole pregnancy so her sister offered to plan her a gender reveal party.  The plan was that all the food and decorations would be blue or pink and in the end we\u2019d get one of those special sparklers that would light up in either blue or pink to reveal the gender.  We went to the doctor and got her to write the result in a folded piece of paper that we passed over to her sister without looking. So flash forward to the day of the party and the moment of truth comes and the sparkler turns out to be pink for a girl. I don\u2019t know what came over me but all I felt at that moment was very bitter disappointment. To be honest, all I was hoping for for baby #2 is to be able to toss a ball around with him and coach little league. Or watch him go on Boy Scouts camping trips.  I know my daughter is only five, but I\u2019ve already started to deal with the dramas of being a father of a girl and the thought of having to double up now on the neuroticism was harrowing. I grew up in a house with three older boys and one younger sister and I can\u2019t imagine seeing myself be outnumbered. My wife grabbed my arm as people were approaching us to say their congratulations and said I needed to look happier. At that moment I just snapped. I shook my head and walked out to my car ( we came separately) and drove to my sister\u2019s (21F) house. I start getting texts from my sister in law and my wife saying \u201c way to reenact\u201d their dad leaving their mom when they were 10 and 12.  I felt like that accusation was unfair and that I just needed some time alone. I didn\u2019t ask to be flabbergasted- it just happened. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that they would have demanded I smile and nod for the next couple of hours. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My wife turned 30 this week. I\u2019m 26M. We\u2019ve always had a strong relationship and I love her so much. My wife has a best friend from childhood Jimmy 28M. I didn\u2019t know him that well but this year we\u2019ve gotten to know each other and have gotten close. He\u2019s my best bud and like an older brother to me in a lot of ways. My wife goes all out for my birthday parties and I love them. She\u2019s more of a stoic introvert so I thought it would be nice to throw her a surprise 30th birthday with just her and me and make it a special event. I wanted to make her a gift she would love. Jimmy\u2019s an incredible artist and for the past two months I\u2019ve been taking lessons from them. My wife was curious why I was spending so much time away from home with Jimmy but I made vague excuses because I couldn\u2019t tell her I was making a gift for her. She\u2019s made a couple comments but never seemed upset. I told her a week before her birthday that I had made plans with Jimmy. I have a job with flexible hours so it\u2019s not uncommon for me to do it.  She wasn\u2019t upset or anything. When her birthday came, it was all I could do not to say anything. When she left for work, I put my plan in action. I decorated the place. I brought out the cake. I learned from youtube and stored it at our friend\u2019s house. I got a dozen bouquets of flowers. I got her a few other gifts too.  She was supposed to come home at 5:30 but she didn\u2019t. I waited hours for her but she didn\u2019t come home. I called Jimmy and he said he hadn\u2019t seen her. I called her and she didn\u2019t pick up. I checked her location and she was at a restaurant. I went to the restaurant and she was there with her friends. They were eating a birthday cake and she had presents. I never met these friends of hers before. I think they\u2019re from her work.  She seemed sad. She wasn\u2019t smiling or energetic. I wanted to take her home and show her my gift so she would be happy. I came over to her and told her she had to come home. We grabbed her things and left. On the uber back, she didn\u2019t say anything. At home she started crying.  She has been sleeping on the couch and she avoids me. My wife hasn\u2019t talked to Jimmy either. I told my mom and she called me an asshole. I don\u2019t know why. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My husband rented his aunts home before we got married. He signed a month to month lease when he moved in. I moved in with him after our marriage because the rent was super cheap. My parents recently came to me asking if they could park their RV at our home.I didn\u2019t see a problem with this. Our yards are really big and there is space.Because of city ordinance the RV has to be parked in the back yard. There was no RV gate in the fence. My husband went to his aunt and asked if we could install a rv gate? His aunt said no. My husband relayed the message to me and my parents seemed upset when I told them. 2 days ago. I came home from work and saw that my dad had a construction crew at our home and had removed part of the fence for the gate. There was a apple tree in the way. They couldn\u2019t fit the RV in the yard. My husband angry told my dad not to continue and that they needed to repair the fence.At this point I felt like it was pointless. The fence guys already built the columns for the gate. It would cost a lot more money to rebuild the fence. I told my dad to finish the job but make sure it was left super clean. That it looked nice. I planned on talking to the aunt later and explain what happened.What I didn\u2019t know was my dad told the guys to remove the tree. My husbands aunt came by and saw the tree cut down and started to cry. She has refused to talk to my dad or me. When my husband came home he found a 30 day notice on our door.Terminating our lease. He tried to call his aunt and she didn\u2019t answer the phone. He then called my MIL and she went to talk to our aunt.Later I got several messages calling me an A for cutting down the aunts late husbands tree. I had no idea he planted the tree. Now my husband and his whole family are really angry at me. I never told them to remove the tree. I feel like I am being thrown under the bus here. Am I the A here?",

        "selftext": " My wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them. As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event. She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the perfect compromise. Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision. I feel like she's doing it to spite me or get me to cave in.",

        "selftext": "I would like others to give me their opinion on this situation. A lot of people are angry with me but I think at the end of the day I did this to help my daughter.  My daughter is seventeen years old. She turned seventeen in February. Since she was around ten, she has been complaining about her lips. She inherited her fathers thin lips. They are a great shape, but they are thin. She has been bullied for it for ages. She has come crying to me about it several times. I thought she would get over it as she got older, but she never has.  My daughter lives with her father and step mother full time because I travel for work. But when I am in town, she tends to stay with me for weeks at a time. We are very close. Two weeks ago she confided in me that she had been saving money for lip injections for two years now. She had a lot of money saved up. We had a heart to heart about it and I decided to go ahead and pay for her to get them from a good doctor. I signed the consent forms and we did it. She is very happy with them, she loves them. They have really balanced out her face.  When it was time for me to leave for work again, I took her back to her father\u2019s. He flipped it. He started yelling at both of us and claiming that we destroyed her face. I apologized to him for not clearing it with him, but it was because I knew that he would say no. This was something she has really wanted for a long time. He argues that she is a child and doesn\u2019t know what she wants. Of course he has spread the news of the lip injections to several family members. They think that it is shameful that I would take my daughter to get plastic surgery and are urging him to limit my visitation (probably not going to happen). I think that they just do not empathize with my daughter and are excited to shame me for letting her get the most minor plastic surgery. She would have gotten it herself anyway, I just wanted to make sure it was done correctly. AITA?",

        "selftext": "Hi all.  Me, my husband and our 15 year old daughter Georgia went to my sister's place for lunch this weekend.  Georgia is very bright. She completed her exams early and is now studying more advanced material. She's a big fashionista, a lot more than I was at that age. She loves pretty clothes and outfits, and we're happy to get her as much as we can, provided she behaves well and keeps up the good grades.  The lunch with my sister was fairly casual, but Georgia wore her new pink dress. My sister isn't as well off as we are unfortunately. She is raising three children on her own and her job isn't a high paying one. In the past, she asked me if Georgia could tone down her outfits when we come to visit, because she doesn't want her kids being upset because they can't afford things like that.  I do get my sister's point but it's not down to me to police what Georgia wears. I have spoken to Georgia about it but I left the final decision to her.  Anyway so we went for lunch, and Georgia ended up getting into an argument when my sister's 13 year old, Lucy, asked about the dress and where it was from. Georgia answered that it didn't matter because Lucy couldn't afford it anyway. We told Georgia to shut up as soon as the comment left her lips, but it soon ended up with Georgia and Lucy screaming at each other.  My sister made the kids vanilla milkshakes, and Lucy decided to throw hers all over Georgia, ruining the dress. Georgia burst into tears and to be fair my sister did bring her a change of clothes. I said that if the dress was permanently ruined, I wanted my sister to reimburse us.   My sister has refused and said that it was our responsibility because my daughter wore an expensive dress despite being warned not to. That dress cost a couple of hundred, and washing it has failed to completely remove the stains. Frankly, I don't care about my sister's warnings. We can't make Georgia wear what she doesn't want to, and it's not our problem that she can't control her child and stop her ruining a beautiful dress.  AITA?",

My parents informed us that they want to split it five ways, my sister gets 2/5 while the three of us brothers get 1/5 each. Their reasoning is that my sister sacrificed her childhood for our family so its only fair she gets compensated. In our childhood, my father's business partner screwed him over so there was a period where we were broke and in debt. My parents had to work multiple jobs to keep us afloat, and my sister babysat us while our parents worked. All she had to do was feed us and keep an eye on us. We were pretty calm kids so all we did was play games and do our homework. It probably wasn't thrilling, but not exactly a tremendous hardship.  I complained to my parents along with my brothers that its insane they want to give my sister 2/5 of the inheritance over that, especially since she's financially the best off out of all of us. She doesn't have any kids and a dual income with her partner.  My parents said they're disappointed in us, and said we need to reflect on ourselves.

When my DIL was pregnant, I suggested that I host a welcoming party for my grandson right after she get discharged from the hospital. I've made arrangements and even emptied a room for them to stay but for some reason, she was against it and said she'd rather spend the first few weeks at home with her newborn. not only that but she said no to the welcoming party. My husband and I talked to my son and he said we'll see. But just a couple a days ago, We found out that my daughter in law had given birth 2 weeks ago and no one knew about it. My nephew told me and I immediately called my son, he confirmed it. he and his wife lied then hid the date of birth from the family. I told him this was not acceptable, lying just because they didn't want a welcoming party and love and support being given from family. I told him I was disappointed because for one...he ruined our welcoming for our grandbaby and also, I invited family members and they're all rightfully disappointed as well. He said it was his last resort after I kept pushing and made his wife uncomfortable but that was not appreciated because.. we were just trying to celebrate the new family member in a proper manner. We had an argument and he ended the call upon saying I ruined his joy for his newborn. My husband started texting him since he stopped replying to our phonecalls and now is threatening to block my nephew for tattling but I think that my nephew was decent enough to inform the family. otherwise God knows how long my son and his wife were going to hide their son just to keep us at arms length. We've always been kind and welcoming to my daughter in law and ger family, I don't why she would do this and disrespect the family like that. on the other hand, some family members see it as a justified action because we insisted on the party. Ps: Some folks, I'd appreciate it if you leave my nephew (m24) out of this conflict because he's not part of it.",

I said that I realized that I had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. I stood up and walked out at that point.

She's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. Absolutely gorgeous. However, there is one issue. Tara has terrible vision. She needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. She gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them. Her eyes can't tolerate contacts. In our ''bridal meeting'' yesterday, I asked if it was possible for Tara to take off her glasses during the main photos. I wasn't saying this to be cruel. I'd never ask her to take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but I'm just asking her to take them off during photos. Without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons. I brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so I could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. I did and it was horrible, but I could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. She left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. I'm doing her a favour. Without the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so I would have thought she'd be OK with it.",

But I found out about the tracking device when I heard him talking on the phone, he said his mom was on the phone and she knew about it but I doubt it because she's close to my SIL and also, when he was talking on the phone it didn't sound like he was talking to his mom. His tone was more formal than usual.",

        "selftext": "So my wife has a friend from childhood named Anthony. I'm being completely honest here when I say that he and I don't get along. It's not like he is rude or disrespectful (nothing like that) but all I feel towards him is annoyance sort of speak because of how much my wife sees him. He lives alone and now suffers from a medical condition (Cancer) that requires him to go to the hospital regularly to receive treatment. I found out that my wife promised him to go with him to his every chemo treatment as support. She said it's a commitment she made to be there for him during this rough time since he has no one else besides him. Okay.....I had no issue with that at first but then this started affecting me. e.g, I can't go see my friends because I have to stay with my son on X day so my wife could be with Anthony for his treatment etc etc. I've talked to her about it but she said that Anthony needs company and that she's just being supportive and this is when he needs her the most. I let it go but last week was just kind of my last straw. Anthony had a other chemo session treatment and my wife wanted to go with him and asked me to stay home with our son. I told her I had a meet up with my mom and sister to eat lunch and that I won't be home, She said she needed to go be with him and I kind of flipped out at her and said that she doesn't need to be with him and could literally go see him at home the next day or something. She threw a fit and called me cruel for forcing her to leave Anthony by himself since she's all he has and that I was making her look bad. She also said my appointment with mom and sister wasn't as important as a chemo session but I decided to just leave to end the argument. She ended up staying at home but kept ignoring me when I got back calling me selfish for not letting her be there to support Anthony with what he's going through. Some of her girlfriends think I'm being a controlling jerk with no consideration for Anthony and what's he's going through. AITA?",

        "selftext": "My(25M) girl Lydia(23F), lives with a roommate who has a boyfriend, Jeff. We gathered at their place last friday for pizza. After a while Jeff asks Lydia if she is still scared of being here alone the nights the roommate goes over to his place and I can't come. Lydia has always had trouble with being alone at night and most nights I stay on facetime with her till she falls asleep so she feels safer. The roommate laughs and says that if she hears a noise in the bathroom at least it will be a ghost and not her locked in passed out. Lydia just mouths explain later to me. When we get to Lydia's room I ask her to explain and she tells me that this afternoon she wasn't feeling good and ended up fainting in the shower, so Jeff had to break to door to roommate get in and help her. She said that she already felt better and didn't wanted to tell me because I was going to be worried about nothing. I said that it wasn't nothing if she had fainted and that I should be aware of these things to help her. She said that now it would be just a funny story about how Jeff broke the door and roommate had to cover her with a towel so they could come to the rescue of her naked body. That moment I saw red. I asked if Jeff had seen her naked and she said she couldn't be sure since she was unconscious but roommate said that he stood out of the bathroom until she was covered. I asked if Lydia thought it was fair to me not to know that another guy had seen her naked and she said he didn't actually saw her naked and that it shouldn't matter since he was only helping. I shouted that she just said that she was unconscious and couldn't know if he saw her. She told me to be quiet or they would hear me and I shouted that I didn't care, that a man just saw my gf body's and I had a right to be mad. Jeff and roommate come in then and explain that he never saw anything, he just broke the lock and waited outside until roommate gave him a clear. I said that I didn't believe him and roommate jumped to his defense saying she was right there making sure the situation wasn't embarrassing so they could take proper care of Lydia without her felling weird. I said that if she was a cuckold I wouldn't be. Jeff then shouted at me saying I should respect his girlfriend and mine, who had spent a whole day saying that she was fine but still looked a bit pale. He said that he only did it because he cared about Lydia, that I was an asshole who didn't deserve any type of help. Hearing him say he cared about her was it for me, I left without as much as looking at Lydia as she begged not to go. Over the weekend Lydia had to be admitted to a hospital as she didn't felt good again and Jeff and roommate prohibited me from seeing her, saying I didn't deserve her. Obviously the whole hospital thing sucks and I wish I was there for her but I still think I was right. At this point I'm not mad at Lydia anymore, just at Jeff. EDIT: They agreed to let me see Lydia upon her asking them to. She said it would be best for us to be away from each other for a while. She is feeling better and for what I heard she is anemic among other things but going home this week.",

My wife (F33) is a big nerd, which I normally appreciate, but she is taking things way too far today. She took today off of work, so she could be up at 4AM to play her online game at launch. I didn\u2019t wake up until about an hour ago (10:30, and she was still playing. I mentioned that I wasHungry, hoping we could make breakfast together , which we like to do together. She instead said that I should \u201corder us something from doordash, im in the middle of a dungeon and may be a while.\u201d I didn\u2019t really wanna get takeout, because we had already discussed ordering pizza tonight for dinner, and that\u2019s a lot of take out food in one day. I calmly explained this, and she got pissed and shrieked at me that she just wanted one weekend to focus on her video game. I said that it was unfair to our family for her to isolate all weekend, and she got even more mad, telling me that I have two hands and can feed the goddamn cat. I was in tears at this point, and I did raise my voice and said that I was worried she\u2019s obsessed with this game and maybe she needs professional help. She threw her car keys at me and said that I need to get out of her face, that she\u2019s works all the time and doesn\u2019t ask for much, and I need to leave her be and get out of her face for a few hours. I am truly concerned that she has become obsessed with this online game, and I\u2019m hoping that maybe reading this thread will wake her up to it, but I might\u2019ve been the AH too. Edit: some additional info I forgot: ir isn\u2019t just today, for the last few weeks she\u2019s been hyping herself up for this. When the game got delayed, she MOVED HER VACATION time rather than just keep her previous day off and spend it with me. She\u2019s been absolutely freaking out about this game and I don\u2019t understand it and it scares me.",

The problem started when I started having sleepovers with my bf in the apartment. Justin looked super annoyed whenever he saw me over which is 5 days a week. He'd just keep huffing and puffing and speak to me rudely. I said nothing til yesterday when he got back and found me and started a fight with me telling me to stop having sleepovers. I asked wtf was his problem and he looked at me with and with a straight face said IF YOU'RE GONNA COME OVER HERE AND USE WATER, ELECTRICITY AND WHATNOT 5 DAYS A WEEK THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL START PAYING RENT!. I responded telling him that my bf pays rent and I use what he uses then called him rude and told him to get over himself. He told me he'll get the landlord involved and my bf asked me to leave so he could figure it out with the guy. I grabbed my stuff and left feeling awful. My bf later called saying I was rude in what I said and his roommate has a point especailly since I'm using everything in the apartment from microwave, shower, charger and so his roommate felt it was unfair and my bf asked me to tune down my visits for now. We had an argument after I said he sided with his roommate over me to keep the peace and ended the call. We haven't talked since then. AITA? Did I go too far?.",

        "selftext": "My kids are Bindi (17) Ava (14) and Fritz (9). I\u2019ll cut right to the problem: my sisters and I are going for an overnight trip late this month. With my oldest sister\u2019s work schedule the only time we can go for the foreseeable future is the 29th. This has been planned for several weeks. Bindi announced to me this week that her school is doing a Halloween dance on the 29th. She was so excited and was excitedly planning her costume, I hated to burst her bubble but I had to tell her she can\u2019t go. You see, Fritz is severely autistic (exactly what you\u2019re probably thinking, he\u2019s nonverbal, no eye contact, no toilet training, that sort of thing). This makes him much more difficult to leave with someone than his sisters ever were \u2013 I could easily find a sitter for them when they were younger. The only people who will even take Fritz outside our household are his grandparents, who cannot watch him that weekend. He also does well with Bindi, meaning she is literally our only option. Bindi didn\u2019t take it well and asked me why Ava can\u2019t watch him for a few hours while she\u2019s at the dance, since Ava has babysat before. Well, Ava is having surgery the Monday before that, nothing major but she is not going to be healed up enough to deal with one of her brother\u2019s meltdowns by Friday. (I\u2019m not saying that would happen but it\u2019s always a possibility with him). She can help but someone else needs to be there and that someone else is going to have to be Bindi. She responded by saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t realize her siblings were so much more important\u201d and went up to her room scowling. I\u2019ve tried knocking and calling her, but she keeps sending me straight to voicemail. I get that she\u2019s upset and was really looking forward to this dance (it\u2019s only for juniors and seniors and school didn\u2019t have it last year thanks to COVID), but I\u2019m going to need her to make a small sacrifice for the family right now. I fully intend to make it up to her. But does expecting her to be there for family make me TA?

        "selftext": "Throwaway because. Last weekend was my (M28) birthday. My girlfriend (F25) had asked what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to watch my favorite movie trilogy, LOTR. I don't think my girlfriend was thrilled but she didn't say anything and agreed. She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing.  But I really wanted to make a day of watching them and I went over to her house because she has a really big comfortable couch.  About ten minutes into the first movie and I look over and she is browsing on her phone. I was a little miffed but didn't say anything. She basically scrolled through her phone the entire movie. When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all.  The third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home.  A few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up. I've texted her a couple times but she hasn't responded. AITA? Edit: This has really blown up and I've gotten a little overwhelmed, but I do accept that I was the asshole. Watching 9 hours of movies that she hates was definitely too much of an ask and I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. I just took it personally because I felt like she didn't even try and these movies are important to me. The fact that she isn't much of a drinker and drank this much kind of set me off. I called and left her a voicemail apologizing.",

        "selftext": "My son is 8 years old and recently attended his friend's 8th birthday party. This friend is my best friend's son. I don't let my son have any/much junk food at all and usually he brings his own snacks (for this incident it was carrot sticks and ranch) to events that have a lot of sugary foods. My best friend bakes a lot, and made a special chocolate cake for her son's birthday. When it comes to my son, I don't let him have cake. This is personal preference for his health, not for any allergy reasons, and he is not diabetic or gluten free. My son knows he isn't allowed to have cake because of the additives. When he told his best friend this at the party, his friend apparently got upset and told him it was good cake, not bad like I say, because his mom made it, and it was his birthday cake. My son ate cake, got a sugar rush, and crashed, making him cranky for the rest of the day after we left the party.  I told my friend she needs to have some kind of consequences for her son to teach him not to peer pressure other children into eating things they're not allowed to have. She said because it wasn't an issue of allergies or health, that she's sorry my son was cranky but she won't be punishing her son or talking to him about it on his birthday. She says also that she'll just that she'll watch more closely/make sure her husband does in the future, as well as have a chat with him on another day about respecting food habits. (I love my friend, but historically, her and her husband have always said 'yes' to their son and not given him any consequences for anything.) Both of us were present at the party and did not see them sharing the cake (they were outside eating in the backyard with their fathers and some other parents supervising while we cleaned up) so it's not an issue of anyone going behind anyone's back, just teaching children boundaries and respect.  I let my son stay for the rest of the party and be with his friend, so it's not like I ruined the day.

I was a little shocked because I like to think I'm nice enough and get along with people, but I was keen to find out what her issue was with me. You don't say good-bye, you just leave is what she said, and it's true. I prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. I do it because if I announce I am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why I'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think yeah I might go too ending the party earlier. I prefer to just disappear.  Anyway I explained myself to this friend and she said no it's super rude. We're Australian so I told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. After that BBQ I made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but I still prefer to ghost. My wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it. tl;dr - I like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, I do thank the host and I now know it's an Irish goodbye). Am I the asshole? Edit: I should note that I do try to tell the host I am leaving (if I can get them alone without causing a scene by saying good-bye) and if not I text them to say thanks. It's just everyone else I'm trying to avoid. Edit 2: she was not the host of this BBQ, it was my in-laws bbq and she was a neighbour that was invited. I ghosted that event late into the night because my house is a few hundred metres down the road and I was 15 shades of fucked up. Edit 3: fmd my inbox is nuked Edit 4: TIL that this is called an Irish goodbye. Thanks for all of the support from fellow Irish goodbyers. Too all the people that think I'm rude, I accept that with open arms and will try tailor my approach a little differently moving forward",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve (M32) been with my girlfriend (F29) for over a year now. She\u2019s smart, funny, a bit quirky, and has a serious job with a good salary. We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home \u2018decor\u2019 is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into.  Her apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though.  My girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet.  I would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It\u2019s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting. This is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone\u2019s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important. My office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over.  My girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner.  I love my girlfriend, I do. And it\u2019s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time. So Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place?",

        "selftext": "My daughter (13) and stepson (11) have not gotten along since my daughter moved in. She had previously lived with her mother but I got default custody after her mother turned one of her 24 hour disappearing acts into a never coming back one. My daughter and stepson go to the same middle school and were both running for student council VP.  There was tension in the house and my wife told my stepson that if he won we could go out to celebrate. My daughter asked if this applied to her as well since he wasn\u2019t her only competitor and my wife said of course. The campaign got pretty stressful for the both of them. Then the votes come in and my daughter wins by 4 votes. However, because somehow the one person who ran for treasurer this year dropped out because of grades, my stepson was offered that position.  He saw it as a really pitiful consolation prize and was angry that he had to take orders from my daughter. I felt very bad for my stepson and he and his mother (who is also very Type A), was very upset, even though of course my wife congratulated my daughter. My stepson refused to be comforted by the fact that older kids get more easily elected because they know more people and his mother even offered to take her to her law office and give him some responsibilities, saying that was better experience than student council would ever be.  My stepson then said \u201c please tell me you\u2019re not going to rub it in my face by taking us to dinner now.\u201d My wife also looks really reluctant to go to dinner.  I finally tell my daughter that we weren\u2019t going to be going to dinner because her stepbrother was very upset by the turn of events and we need to take his feelings into consideration. And that I was impolite to gloat. That all happened Friday. My daughter ended up crying and even now, Sunday night, she still is mad at all of us. AITA?",

She wants just her and I to also have a roast chicken at the table (I think some sides to). I think it would be incredibly rude to have an openly much better meal than our guests would have.

        "selftext": " I'll preface this by saying that I (M35) am a widower with 2 kids (9, 11). I recently got back to work and since I work nightshifts, I had to get the kids a babysitter (they're at school during the day and my sister stays with them) I was able to find a babysitter with the help of a co worker (actually they're related) and things have been going pretty well except for few days ago. The babysitter called me while I was at work to tell me that my 9 year old daughter broke her glasses, I got home, heard both sides of the story and came to a conclusion that it was in fact an accident. but the babysitter said my daughter broke them intentionally after she refused to let her outside late in the evening. I asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, I figured she lied to set her sister up. my 9 year old daughter cried and said she didn't mean it and it was an accident. I apologized to the babysitter for the misunderstanding but she insisted there was no misunderstanding and then asked me to pay her for a pair of new glasses. I was taken aback by her request and told her I thought we talked this out and rolled it out as an accident but she insisted it wasn't an accident. I apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of wether it was an accident or not. The babysitter argued with me then started crying swearing that my daughter broke them to get back at her. My 11 year old daughter sided with her but my 9 year old said she is only siding with the babysitter for her own benefits. The girls started fighting and I ended up telling the babysitter to leave. she got my co worker involved and she said I should take responsibility and pay the babysitter for new glasses since she can not afford them being a broke college student and in need for glasses. I apologized but refused to pay, my co worker got upset and shamed me for condoning my younger daughter's actions and treating the babysitter poorly when she's the victim in this situation. It's been days and the babysitter is still wanting me to pay for new glasses but I feel like she's trying to use the fact that I'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.",

        "selftext": "My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons.  So here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me.  Between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ok sure. And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question.  I want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

So My wife Liz and I have been married for 7 years. we have preschool age kids, and because we currently live in the same city as my parents. Mom would take the kids while my wife and I work. Liz is the one with a much larger income, she got an even better job opportunity that is requiring us to move to another city. I agreed since I could easily find a job in my field in the city we're moving to. but after my family heard we were selling the house to move, hell broke loose. Sunday, mom and Liz got into a huge fight because Liz told mom we'll move away and hire a babysitter for the kids so she's no longer needed. mom said she doesn't want her grandkids moving away, even said we should let the kids live at her house while we move. Liz laughed at her and mom lost it basically saying that Liz was an ungrateful witch and that her grandkids moving will only happen over her dead body. they began exchanging harsher words and Liz snapped and told mom to butt out of private matters that don't concern her. and said that she had no right to decide things regarding the kids. Mom firmly told her she was dead wrong and proceeded to tell her that she, as an involved grandmother, knows her rights and she will be taking Liz and me to court to ensure she still gets to see her grankids. Liz was in shock, she looked to the left and saw me sitting there not saying or doing anything. She told me to check my mom but I told her she was being unfair to mom and that mom had to feel upset because she will no longer be able to see her grandchildren - I honestly told Liz that she was a bit selfish to not consider my mom's feelings and her crucial presence in the kids life first. Liz started arguing with me saying she couldn't believe I didn't stand behind her and defend her after hearing mom saying she'd get the court involved. I said mom was upset and can not be blamed for her reaction. Liz started yelling at me calling me unsupportive and an enabler then went home with the kids, insisting my family is MY problem and I should handle it although this whole moving thing was her idea. Situation hasn't been resolved and Liz and mom are getting more intense in their fights. I choose to stay out of it because both have valid arguments but Liz has called me awful for not siding with her after seeing how mom spoke to her and being okay with the fact that mom was willing to cause us issues in court. AITA? I get that Liz wants my support but I feel like mom has been punished through no fault of her own after being a loving grandmother to my kids.",

My older daughter (17f) was against them, she's much more princessy and didn't want to deal with the mess and chores that come with horses, but we told her it wouldn't be something she'd have to deal with and that her younger sister promised to take care of all of it. Well, recently the older daughter has been disrespectful at home and staying out too late, and her grades have been slipping.  We warned her to shape up, but last week when we heard that she'd been needlessly insulting to her younger sister while I was our running errands, I told her that she'd be cleaning out the stable each day for the next week as punishment, and that her sister would get a break. She got really upset and offended, and said we promised she'd never have to go in there or have to scoop horse poop. I said I promised it wouldn't be one of your chores, of course, but obviously a punishment is supposed to be something outside of your normal chores and something you won't like, and I thought it was perfectly fair here. She's been doing it three days now but seems to be very resentful of our broken promise, acting very disgusted, and keeps begging to get out of the rest of it. But I said I thought it's very fair and that she's overreacting.

        "selftext": "throwaway for privacy.  My wife (23) and I (27) are expexting. She's due this month and things have been bit intense recently with her being extra hormonal. We live in different state then my family. My wife and I couldn't visit for Christmas. my parents were calling to continue complaining about us not spending Christmas with them and demanded I make it up for them. I said I was open for any suggestions they had and they suggested they come stay with us for a week once the baby is born. That way they could spend time with us and the baby as well. I thought why not that seemed to be a pretty good suggestion since it's been months since we've seen each others so I told them to go ahead and made the invitation Official. This morning my wife was talking about her plans once the baby is here and that's when I remembered my conversation with my parents. I immediately told her that I agreed to let them over for a week once the baby is born to make up for the holiday we missed with them. She first looked shocked then freaked out at me saying I shouldn't have invited them just like that without talking to her first. I asked why not since she loves them and loves being around them but she explained that my family can be a lot of work and having them as guests while caretaking for a newborn is the last thing she wanted. I told her it was no big deal besides that we could use help if she thought about this way but she lashed out on me about how the first few days of the baby's life is essential time for bonding and being intimate and I just took that away from her by inviting my parents and invading her space. I argued that she was being melodramatic right then because my family are decent people and I'm pretty sure they'll make this experience a lot more warmer but she still disagreed and said if my family were decent then they wouldn't have accepted my invitation but I clarified to her that I did NOT invitem and this was in fact a suggested made by them and I just agreed AFTER they complained about me missing spending the holidays with them. She went off on me demanding I call them and cancel everything I planned with them but I thought that was unacceptable since she gave not a good-enough reason for me to do that and besides my parents can help but she still denied that being true. She's gone radio silence for the rest of the day and is acting like my family are somehow making her uncomfortable though they're not the judgemental or intrusive type and are just about spending time with each others. AITA? Hold on! #Edit few things so there's no misunderstanding here. Alright? First of all my wife doesn't normally have an issue with my family being around, they all get along pretty good. and second of all which is an important info my wife and I talked about having her directly speak to them about why she would rather postpone their visit so we could clear the air but she refused and said she doesn't want to ruin her relationship with them and asked me to do it (tell them not to come) but since my family are upset with me then me telling them not to come might be taken in an offensive way, you know what I'm saying? so it really feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. also, to all the people saying that my wife shouldn't be hosting guests. I don't recall mentioning this nor expecting her to do anything for the family. matter of fact I really thought we could maybe use their help especially my mom.",

        "selftext": "So I have been dating this Girl for awhile now. She's beautiful. She works as a professional model. Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything. She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor. So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about. I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money? **Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends. **Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me. I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has. I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.  **Final Edit At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post. I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.  First I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.  Next I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to show her off in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.  After this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.  What I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).  The second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as the bad guy and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)  I definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.  I told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out  First off its not as glamours as I thought it was  She said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model  She works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a Model defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a model is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.  She doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.  This is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.  Finally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.  I know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account and fake names because my wife is also on Reddit. And sorry for the long post.  My wife (39F) and I (42M) have three sons, Alex (15), Dylan (11), and Jake (8). When I was a kid I always wanted a dog but my parents said no. I never got the chance to get one during my twenties but recently my interest in owning one was sparked again so I asked my family what they thought about getting a dog. My wife wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about it but she relented after a few weeks of me asking. Alex and Jake were excited to get one but Dylan was immediately opposed to the idea.  Dylan was always different than my other sons, he never had an interest in sports and was always more subdued than his brothers which has always made it hard for me to connect with him.  He remained opposed to the idea of getting a dog but me and my other sons managed to wear him down until he finally relented. However, he said that if we did get a dog, he wasn\u2019t going to be interacting with it or taking care of it, that would be completely on me and his brothers. I found this ridiculous but i agreed in the moment hoping he would change his mind after meeting the dog.  The problem is he hasn\u2019t changed his mind yet. We\u2019ve had Zeus for seven months now and Dylan has not warmed up to him in the slightest.  He doesn\u2019t play with the dog, he doesn\u2019t cuddle with him, he doesn\u2019t let Zeus into his room because he \u201cdestroys stuff\u201d and whenever he is near the dog he just ignores him. I find this completely ridiculous. Zeus loves Dylan, he follows him around whenever he sees him and jumps on him to get his attention and play but Dylan just isn\u2019t receptive to it. To change this, I told Dylan last week that he would be in charge of walking the dog every day after school. Dylan straight up refused and has shut down the conversation every time I bring it up. It\u2019s been a week and he hasn\u2019t walked the dog once.  In my frustration, I told him that if he didn\u2019t start listening then I wouldn\u2019t allow him to go to the comic book store anymore and he freaked and told my wife. Now, my wife is upset with me, claiming that I knew what I was getting into with this and I knew that Dylan wouldn\u2019t be playing with the dog but his intolerance of the dog is weird and I refuse to entertain it any longer.  My wife has been short with me ever since that conversation and Dylan is cold with me as well. Alex is now agreeing with his mother which is making me have second thoughts. So Reddit, AITA?",

Me and my husband's divorce just got finalized last month and it's honestly a different type of pain, but I thankfully have wonderful friends and family who've been supporting me all the way. We had Christmas dinner with family. A lot of my relatives kept checking in with me, asking if I was doing okay and bringing me food. I felt really loved and it was pretty fun overall, and took my mind off everything for a bit. My cousin A's fiance recently passed. She was at dinner, but wasn't talking much and mostly kept to herself. I saw her getting soda, so I asked if she could bring me one as well. That didn't go well. A got upset and started going off at me, why she should have to bring me things and I can get my own. I told her it's completely fine if she doesn't, I just asked since she was already there and she's making a big deal. A looked like she was about to cry, and kept going off about how I expected everyone to fawn over me and no one cares about her and her fiance. I told A we're all doing our best. I'm sorry if she feels that way but this isn't a grief competition, and she should understand that. A few people overheard us, but the conversation changed and it wasn't a huge issue. A's sister messaged me later that what I said to A is awful and we're all awful to her. I told my best friend what happened and she suggested I post on here for opinions. I didn't think this was such a big deal, but A thought otherwise. Was I the asshole here?",

We only gave plus ones to married couples or if we knew the SO well. My husband has one childhood friend that was coming from out of state to attend. I\u2019ve met him a bunch but only his girlfriend of three years a few times because of the distance.  I didn\u2019t want to give him a plus one but my husband begged since he was traveling and didn\u2019t know anyone else at the wedding and he didn\u2019t want him to be uncomfortable or have to travel alone. I said fine just to make him happy.  Flash forward to the reception I see him with some girl I have never seen before. I asked husband what was up and he told me that his friend and his gf broke up a few days before the wedding and since he already rsvped as 2 he brought a friend with him.  I was pissed since I made an exception for him and I didn\u2019t want anyone random at my wedding. I had one of my bridesmaid go to him and tell him he could stay but can his date please go back to the hotel this is a private event.  He said ok and didn\u2019t make a fuss but he left with her and didn\u2019t come back. I though on everything was fine and had a great night.  My husband found out about it the next day and we got in an argument. He\u2019s mad because his friend traveled and I kick him out without talking to him. I didn\u2019t kick him out just his date.  Now it\u2019s a few weeks later my husband still brings it up from time to time and his friend hasn\u2019t been answering his texts. I kind of feel bad but it was my wedding and I didn\u2019t want any strangers there.",

She wanted me to play it but I initially declined since I'm not into visual novels or reading long stories but after she begged, I gave it a try and played for a good 15 mins. Now I can tell she put in a lot of effort in the writing and the art and it was a good start but I just got tired of reading and stopped. She asked what I thought and wanted me to eventually finish it and tell her what I thought about the choices and the endings but I told her I had no plans to. She looked shocked and asked if it was boring, I told her no, it's just that I'm just not into this type of genre and she knows im not into reading but asked me to make an exception this time since she made it. I got upset because I think she is being childish and wants to blackmail me into doing something I don't want. After I made it clear I wasn't continuing, she hasn't talked to me. I already know that she is talented and smart so just because I don't want to play it doesn't mean I dont support her. Some of my friends agree she's being immature but others think I should be more supportive. So AITA?",

        "selftext": "My son is 18, He is going to be attending community college and is living with me, my husband and his 2 younger half sisters. The other day I found out that he found and accepted a job without telling me. I was upset with him about it and the reason for that is that first of all, he should've told me since we live in the same house and also, and more importantly now I'm left without someone to stay with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted. He told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but I don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while I work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a pilot) and paid child care is a no for me. My son said I shouldn't be surprised by him trying to work to save money to be able to pay for himself but that is just absurd since he literally lives with us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. He said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. We kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a like it or not attitude with us and kept refusing to discuss this wirh us saying we have no right to be upset with him and should just accept it. but I'm just...I think that he's being inconsiderate of my husband's and I's struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly. ETA okay, it seems that I did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything. ETA Okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that I'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. He doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. He adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. Also, my husband said the girls are too young for therapy and I agree with him on that.",

        "selftext": "So, two weeks ago, I (25F) got married to my husband (26M). When I was six years old, my mom and dad got divorced and, three years later, my mom met and married Fred, who had basically been my surrogate dad for all these years because my biological one hasn't been a huge part of my life, and Fred's kids (20M), (18F) and (16M) are basically my siblings.  On last minute, my bio-dad decided he didn't want to come to my wedding and walk me down the aisle. I got the call while I was getting my makeup done and I was devastated, needless to say. Fred was in the room with me and he started comforting me, telling me it would all be okay, and he said if you want, I can walk you down.  That just rubbed me wrong and I was already a mess emotionally. Fred knew how much I wanted my bio-dad to walk me down the aisle, and he just suggested it like it didn't matter at all, like I hadn't just gotten my heart broken, and I just snapped and told him he was selfish and told him to get out. Fred left and one of my uncles ended up walking me down the aisle.  My mom only heard about mine and Fred's fight AFTER the wedding, and she is now pissed off at me, telling me that I overreacted and that I needed to apologize to Fred even though I was just frustrated and he had suggested something totally out of the leftfield. My mom told me that I was the selfish one apparently and apparently I'm ungrateful.  But I feel like his suggestion was completely wrong and that I don't need to apologize, but I don't want to make things worse by not apologizing if I did do something wrong. So, aita?",

        "selftext": "I (39M) have a son (17 M) who recently got a girlfriend. His girlfriend is black and a very nice, kind and beautiful young lady. I have met her and invited her for dinner and family events plenty of times and she\u2019s a joy to be around. But recently my mother has been staying with us because she  is recovering from a surgery she had and she\u2019s going on 70 years old so she can\u2019t do much on her own. Long story short my mother is a classic racist and being a raging narcissist and she is not one to hold back from her opinions. I showed her a photo of my son and his girlfriend and she went on a 2 hour rant about bloodlines and kept saying they \u201cdon\u2019t look right\u201d and when I said she was coming to dinner she said doesn\u2019t want the girl near her because it\u2019ll \u201cdisturb her\u201d so last minute I told her she could not come. My son has been trying to invite his girlfriend over everyday since but I said no multiple times due to his grandmother being here and her saying she doesn\u2019t want her near her, I just don\u2019t want any problems. But he argues that I am being \u201ca complacent racist\u201d by even allowing her to be here. And even more so for not allowing her to come over to \u201cprotect a racist\u201d. He says I should of told her to leave the moment my mother said all that stuff. But my mother is an elderly woman who can hardly make it on her own as it is. Definitely much harder after surgery. Though I don\u2019t agree with her I can just leave her to fend for herself. I literally do not know what to do. My wife says my son is right about me being complacent but of course she\u2019d agree because her and my mother don\u2019t get along well. I know I am not a damned racist. But now everyone is saying I am aiding one by taking my mothers side. So AITA? Edit: Hello everyone last night I posted this after me and my son argued over this all day and my wife is giving me the silent treatment. I can really reply to anyone because the moderators locked this post. I woke up this morning with thousands of notifications. I just posted this thinking maybe 20 people would reply. The messages and comments are overwhelming. But I will answer everything as best as I can. Firstly no I can not afford to put my mother in a home. I\u2019m not rich and I\u2019m not poor but I do have 3 children I need to provide for and my wife. The savings I have I won\u2019t spend on anything but their college funds. And my mother definitely doesn\u2019t have the money to afford those homes. She lives by herself, with me and younger my sister occasionally going over a few times a week to help her. This situation is just special because she had benign tumor removed. If I could of I would have had her stay with my sister but my sister is pregnant and very soon to go into labor. So I offered her to stay. She is a difficult person to be around but she\u2019s my mother and she\u2019s still has about 7 more weeks until she\u2019s able to go back to being on her own. Second, I have no problem with my sons girlfriend. I actually would be happy if he chose to settle down with her in the future. I want to welcome her in my home. She had been coming over and basically apart of the family for months now up until this. And now my son says she thinks we don\u2019t want her around anymore. I can see why people are saying I am the asshole after reading through I still am unsure how to go about this still. People are saying I should invite her over and tell my mom that she will not say anything out of the norm to her or else I\u2019ll send her off. But people are also saying I should not bring her over knowing it\u2019s a possibility that my mother will do something anyway. Kicking my mother to curb for now is not an option but I will privately tell his girlfriend the situation and ask her what she would like to do and make arrangements from there. Also people are calling my son an AH for wanting her to come over because of this. I am okay with being criticized on here but please do not shame my son. I think he is just getting anxious because him and her don\u2019t go to the same school and the only way they see each other at my house because my son says her father is very overprotective and intimidates him every time he goes to her house. I do understand I was going about this in a very easy way by just doing what my mother says for the time being because I did not want to start drama. But she is the bad guy in the situation and she is the one who needs to change and I should not be accommodating her prejudice ways and my son or his girlfriend should not have to suffer because of her.  Thanks for all the advice.",

        "selftext": "Yeah it sounds bad but it really was an innocent thing. I was at a cookout with my wife's family and I just opened up a cold one. My wife's three year old neice asked me what I was drinking, and I told her it was beer. She asked to taste it, so I poured her like a tenth of a sip into a plastic cup thinking it will be bitter for her, but, well, she liked it. She wanted more and I told her it was a grownup drink but it was too late. She ran around demanding to drink more beer for the entire cookout, she wouldn't eat anything, just demanded beer, and they had to put her in a time out. Anyway, the inlaws are mad now and the wife isn't happy. So AITA? Edit: the kids are given watered down wine on  shabbas if it's relevant Update: apologised and sorted it out with the in laws. They know I love that little rascal and would never intend to harm her. I do agree with people that things like that should be leveled with the parents first. Interesting that the divide along YTA/NTA was highly correlated with upbringing - Europeans and more rural oriented Americans (for lack of better wording) did realise that this a just a dumb brain fart on my part at worst, and just being an uncle at best. I think mostly Americans were highly critical of my actions, there does seem to be a series taboo regarding alcohol and boundaries in that culture. I guess its a matter of outlook, as most things are. Having said that, I got some literal death threats, and some people said I should be locked up and never ever be around children. Really now?",

        "selftext": "I feel like the devil right now, so I\u2019ll accept whatever judgement you all have. I run a team of about 6 people. Our company offers a large amount of maternity leave, 10 months. One of my employees got pregnant recently, i\u2019ll call her Jess.  Our team does project based work and in the period between her leaving for ML we finished up the project we were working on when she left, and started working on a project without her.  During this period, our team had to adapt to working without her expertise in certain matters. We adapted and eventually some of us developed the skills needed to do some of her workload. The situation we have now is me, and 2 others split half the work that Jess used to do, and we hired someone new to come in to the team to handle the other part of Jess\u2019s workload and then some.  This new employee came at significantly reduced cost, as he was straight out of Uni and we pay him a fraction of what Jess costs currently.  Now Jess has come back to the team, but there is another issue.  Our firm has informed us that for some fucking reason we no longer have the budget for a 7 person team, and will have to let someone go. This news came about when I submitted the paperwork for Jess\u2019s return.  We are 5 months into a project that should take an estimated 10 months, and my decision came down to Jess and the man we hired to replace her. The reason we hired a replacement, which is not normally what we do, is because we anticipated that for this project the workload would be far greater than our current capacity, which it is not.  As you can tell by the title, I chose the replacement. I did so for the following reasons:  * Far cheaper, thus freeing up a lot more money than keeping Jess on* He was up to date with the project and we would be able to move forward seamlessly, whereas with Jess we would have to take time catching her up to speed on half the project* The clients already knew and liked working with him, whereas they didn\u2019t know Jess at all* She has been out of the field for a prolonged period, whilst he has been here for the past 9 months, so she may, or may not, find it hard to adapt back to work life, whilst with him it isn\u2019t a question* He performed his work better than she did hers and interacted better with the team.  Obviously, the ideal situation which I wanted was to keep both and not put a new single mother with no other job lined up out in the cold, but I had to do right by the team and firm. I told her I\u2019d write her a brilliant Letter of Recommendation, and that in a few months she could try and apply for a job at our firm, hopefully we\u2019ll have the budget, but she snapped at me and told me not to bother, and called me a cunt and left.  I know I sound cold and heartless but I had to be fair to both employees, not just Jess, right?  AITA?",

I told Alan ahead of time that I would probably leave early and that me and the rest of our family would take two cars so that they could stay if they wanted to. He looked like he didn\u2019t mind at the time. So at the wedding itself, after the ceremony I basically told him that I was glad and it looked great but I was going to go home. He asked if I was going to at least stay for cake or for food but the food didn\u2019t look all that appetizing to me so I told him I was just going to leave. He said \u201calright whatever just go\u201d and I went back to my table to get my stuff. I told my wife and she said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving back alone (the venue was very far from us and the roads there were not great). I said in that case she should come with me and after some hemming and hawing she agreed. So we left. Then two days later Alan\u2019s new wife bombarded me and my wife with messages that she was disgusted with us, saying horrible things about us and insulting us as people and as parents. Really just sickening. I told her off and asked why she thought it was okay to talk to her in laws like that and she said that us leaving \u201cruined\u201d the wedding for Alan and that he was very upset for the rest of the night. She continued to berate us. I politely told her to leave us alone and called Alan, mainly to inform him that his wife had a temper that he should know about. When we talked about it he basically started berating me too and said things like \u201cyou always do this\u201d and \u201cjust leave me alone\u201d before hanging up. I feel like I\u2019m justified since I told him ahead of time that I wasn\u2019t going to stay. AITA here? Edit since so many people care about the details: Yes there was a mother son dance planned. Yes he included me in the count for the food costs. Yes I love him. No this does not mean that I do not care about him.",

We're having another and when I had my ultrasound, I was told it was another girl, again my husband was Happy. Turns out I was told wrong, and it's actually a boy we're having, ny my husband freaked out in excitemet. His reaction to us having a boy was *nothing* like his either of his reactions to having a girl. He was actually jumping around and yelling, he immediately called all his friends and family, he kept hugging and swinging our daughter around telling her she's getting a brother. I confronted him about not being this excited about having girls, and he said \u201ccause I wanted a boy \u201d. I got so pissed off, I don't want him at the baby shower (I guess it's not really a baby shower as we're not asking for anything, but still) or the birth.  He thought I was kidding at first, but once he realized I serious got really upset and started an argument over it. WIBTA if I didn't let him attend the baby shower or birth?",

        "selftext": "So we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'I do', 'Sarah' and I would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. It was her idea and I thought it would be fun.  Fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. We look through them together for the first time- to summarise: Her photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me. My photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen. As soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. She replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. This conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. I feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, I need to know if I'm in the wrong. So, am I the asshole here? I... feel like she's overreacting a little. I thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. I didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her. **EDIT: Info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. The cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. I remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. She prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more** **EDIT 2** I'm the asshole. And a clueless idiot. From now on I'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. Thank you to all who have judged me, I accept my judgement",

        "selftext": " My wife and I had our babyboy 5 weeks ago. Everythibg's going fine, no health problems or complications whatsoever. However, my wife is often exhausted so I let my mom come over to help out with cleaning and stuff (I can barely have time to work) and also, at the same time, Spend time with the baby and bond with him a little bit. Thing is my wife acts strange whenever she sees my mom with our son. She'd make a face and talk to her in a descending tone, even raises her voice at her causing mom to feel hurt. I asked my wife about it and she said it was because of what my mom is doing. I asked her to elaporate and she complained about mom holding the baby for long and taking forever to give him back to her. mom argued that my wife could ask nicely instead of outright yelling but my wife defended herself saying that she only starts raising her voice after she's already asked a couple of times and mom won't listen. They started arguing and mom started crying. that's when I felt enraged,  pulled my wife aside and told her to stop acting out and that if she keeps this up then we won't get anymore help from mom. She argued that she was trying to feed our son and that it was awful of me to think of it as acting out. I said I understood her frustration and yes mom can do things that require some patience from us. but a little kindness can go a long way in keeping the peace in this difficult time. She called me selfish and said that it's easy for me to say when I'm not the one dealing with this. from there the argument escalated despite me trying to cut it short. I went outside to calm down and after that my wife started cold shouldering me. I told her this was not okay but she told me to go sc*ew myself and that from now on out I should deal with taking our son back from my mom when it's time for feeding since I condone this behabior. I really am not condoning anything and really think she's stressed out yes but the way she behaves around mom is, in my opinion, not okay. ETM:: My goodness! I'm seeing so much anger here. I'm sorry I can not respond to you all but I just want people to calm down and understand that I in no way  agree with some of my mom's behaviors, just how my wife reacts is......not okay and that's all. really. thank you very much though! Ok. have a nice day.",

        "selftext": "I (26F) have an older brother (27M) who's been dating another guy (30M) for around 4 years. I don't have any issue with my brother being gay, but I have one with him wearing a wedding ring in order to pretend that he's married to him. You see, we live in a country where gay marriage still isn't allowed (Romania), but despite this, my brother and his boyfriend started wearing weddings rings recently. When I asked my brother about it, he told me that despite not being able to do it legally, they already consider themselves married spiritually and they're hoping that one day gay marriages will be allowed to do legally as well, either by leaving the country or waiting till gay marriages are made legal here as well. While I think this nice, I told him that they shouldn't be wearing wedding rings till they actually get officially married, as I think it's kind of distasteful. He told me that they're just a symbol of their love and that they're not hurting anyone by wearing them, but I disagreed, they're actively misleading people into thinking that they're actually married and frankly just making a mockery out of marriage.  My brother told me that he doesn't care what other people, including me, think about them wearing wedding rings and maybe they should just mind their own business, then left furiously. Not gonna lie, I think his comment here was kind of out of line, as all I did was to give my opinion on people wearing wedding rings when they're actually married yet and he seemed to take it personally. His boyfriend also contacted me later and told me that their romantic lives doesn't concern me and to stay out of it. AITA ?",
